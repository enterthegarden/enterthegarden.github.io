    In first aid, every second counts. So, make yourself count in these emergencies. Make yourself prepared. Before anything else, ensure the safety of the scene. Look at the situation quickly, but thoroughly. If they're choking, act quickly. Do the Heimlich manoeuvre. Wrap your arms around their waist. Make a fist above their navel. And give quick thrusts upwards. If you don't know the manoeuvre, tell them to cough forcefully. If they're unresponsive and not breathing, do CPR. 30 chest compressions. 2 rescue breaths. Rinse and repeat until help arrives. If they're unresponsive, but still breathing, put them in the recovery position. Do not leave their side. Watch them closely. For a life-threatening situation, do not hesitate. Call the emergency services. You should know their numbers. Give them your location and emergency details. Be precise and be concise. If you see heavy bleeding, get a clean cloth. Apply it to the wound with firm and direct pressure. Then elevate the wound. And maintain the pressure until the bleeding stops. But, if it's just a cut, clean it thoroughly with water and soap. Then apply antibiotic ointment and bandage it up. Every single burn needs to be put under cold running water for 10 minutes. If it's severe, call the emergency services. Do not hesitate. If you suspect a fracture, immobilise it. Use a splint or sling. And avoid any movement. Lastly, if you see an allergic reaction, react quickly. Remove the allergen. Apply their EpiPen. Throughout the emergency, stay with the person. Keep calm, and keep them comfortable. In first aid, you need to be decisive, quick, and confident. Prepare yourself. Act smart. And act fast.

    <b><a id="savingsomeonechoking">Saving Someone Choking</a></b>: <span class="summary">In a choking emergency, recognise the situation, perform back blows and abdominal thrusts, then continue until the object is dislodged or the person collapses.</span> When someone is choking, you need to be quick. You’ve got seconds to save them. Here’s what to do. First, recognise the signs. If they can't cough, speak, or breathe, they need help NOW. Call for backup. If it’s just you and the choking person, you’ll have to jump into action straightaway. But, if someone else is there, tell them to call the emergency services. And if they don’t have a phone? Unlock yours, hand it to them, and get the phone dialling. In fact, tell them to shout out the address to them too. When people are panicking, they can freeze up and forget basic things. You need to be the one in control of the situation. Begin first aid by doing back blows on the choking person. Stand behind them, slightly to the side. Slam the heel of your hand between their shoulder blades, up to 5 times. Check after each blow if they’ve managed to get the object out. If that’s not working, it’s time to use the Heimlich manoeuvre, which is basically abdominal thrusts. Stand behind them. Wrap your arms around their waist. Make a fist above their navel, which you will grab with your other hand, and give 5 quick, upward thrusts. Again, check after each set of back blows if they’ve managed to get the object out. Then keep going in this cycle: 5 back blows followed by 5 abdominal thrusts. Keep going. Don't stop until it’s out of their throat or they’ve become unresponsive. If they collapse, lay them down gently. Call for help if you haven’t already. If you’re trained in CPR, then do it. But, if you’re not, the emergency dispatcher will guide you until help arrives. The choking person might be pregnant or obese, in which case you’ll have to do chest thrusts instead of abdominal thrusts. It’s the same deal, but in a different spot. Once the object is dislodged and the person can breathe again, have them checked by a medical professional to ensure no complications. It’s quite possible, for example, that their airway has been damaged and they’re too full of adrenaline to realise it. Remember, every second counts. Stay calm, assess fast, and act faster. Take a first aid course to learn this hands-on. It's a lifesaver.

  <p>
    <b><a id="pressureonwounds">Applying Pressure to a Wound</a></b>: <span class="summary">To treat a wound, safely apply direct pressure using clean material, elevate the wound, and maintain pressure.</span> Now the details. First, make sure you are safe and the scene is safe. There’s no point in having two victims. If there’s time and you can do it, get some gloves on. Blood can carry nasty diseases and you could be exposing yourself to blood-borne pathogens. Then identify the source of bleeding and quickly assess the wound. Now that you know where exactly the wound is, apply direct pressure to the wound. Use your gloved hands, a clean cloth, gauze, or whatever’s sanitary and available. Just keep pressing firmly down on the source of bleeding. If it’s possible, get that bleeding body part up above their heart. Elevating it above their heart means less blood flow, which means less bleeding. If the blood is soaking through the initial cloth or dressing, resist the instinct to remove it. Instead, add more layers on top and continue applying pressure. If it’s been a few minutes and it’s still bleeding, call the emergency services. Tell them what’s happened, how bad they’re bleeding, and exactly where you are. Set up your phone so that you can operate it one-handed. Now keep direct pressure on the wound until emergency responders can take over. Don’t lift pressure to check the wound - just keep pressing. Watch for signs of shock. Cold, clammy skin, rapid breathing, and decreased alertness. Keep them warm. Keep them calm. Until help arrives. Once the medics take over, remove your gloves and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water. Remember, direct pressure is key. Act fast and don't let up until help arrives. I will always recommend getting certified in first aid to have confidence with these procedures.
  </p>


  <p>
    <b><a id="cpr">Doing CPR</a></b>: <span class="summary">To do CPR, check for safety and responsiveness, call for help, then perform 30 chest compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths in cycles.</span> Now, make sure you are safe and the scene is safe before approaching the person. You’ve got to check if they're responsive first. Tap their shoulder. Shout, "Are you okay?" And if there’s no response and the person is not breathing or only gasping, they might need CPR. Call the emergency services. If you’re alone, make the call and put your phone on speaker. You’ll need to shout your location so be mentally ready for that. But if someone else is there, get them to make the call. Now, open the airway of the victim. Tilt the person's head back slightly and lift their chin. Check for their breathing. Look, listen, and feel for no more than 10 seconds. If there’s still no breathing or only gasping, you’ll need to do CPR. Give 30 chest compressions. Place the heel of one hand on the centre of the chest, on the lower half of the breastbone. Place your other hand on top, interlock your fingers, and push straight down at least 2 inches (5 centimetres) at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. Let the chest fully rise back up after each compression. Give 2 rescue breaths. Tilt the victim’s head back and lift the chin to open the airway again. Pinch the nose shut, take a normal breath, cover the person's mouth with yours, and blow in for about 1 second to make the chest visibly rise. Keep the CPR cycles going. Keep giving cycles of 30 chest compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths. Minimise pauses in the compressions. If an AED (automated external defibrillator) is available, turn it on and follow the audio prompts exactly as it tells you to do. They’re set up so that you don’t need formal training. Regardless, watch a demonstration or video of how it works at least five times. Do not leave the victim’s side to go and look for an AED. Keep giving CPR until the person starts breathing or professional help takes over. And if they have started breathing, then put them in the recovery position. Remember: call for help, start compressions early, push hard and fast in the centre of the chest, and keep interruptions to a minimum. High-quality CPR can be the difference between life and death in cardiac arrest.

    <b><a id="callambulance">Calling for Help in an Emergency</a></b>: <span class="summary">To call for help in an emergency, assess the situation, make the call, then provide your location and details.</span> This is an absolutely crucial first aid skill. It’s more than just knowing 999, 911, 112, or whatever your local emergency number is. The ‘bystander’ effect means most people with fully functioning phones stand around in an emergency doing nothing because they always think someone else will do it. You must overcome this and be the one to do it. First things first: assess the situation. Quickly determine the nature of the emergency and if immediate assistance is required. Make sure the scene is safe before you approach the person needing help. If you determine that you need assistance, don't hesitate. Now call the appropriate emergency number for your area. I can’t list them all, but it’s 999 in the UK, 911 in North America, and 112 in Europe. Never enter any country without learning the emergency numbers. When you get the operator on the line, stay calm and speak clearly. This is no time for panic or mumbling. Identify yourself and briefly explain the nature of the emergency. Tell them your exact location, including the street address, city, and any nearby landmarks that could help emergency services find you quickly. You should always know where you are. Answer the operator's questions as accurately and concisely as possible. They just need the relevant medical facts. No backstory. Follow any instructions they give you and listen carefully. Don't even think about hanging up until the operator tells you it's okay to do so. And if it’s possible, send someone to guide the emergency crew to your precise location. Every second counts in a crisis, so make it as easy as possible for help to reach you. Remember: when calling for help in an emergency, stay calm, speak clearly, and provide all the relevant details.

    <b><a id="recoveryposition">Putting Someone in a Recovery Position</a></b>: <span class="summary">To put a person in the recovery position, ensure the safety of the scene, check their responsiveness, roll an unconscious but breathing person onto their side, and adjust their head to ensure they have an open airway.</span> Alright, now listen up. If you come across someone who's unconscious but still breathing, you need to act quickly and put them in the recovery position. Standard procedure. Before you do anything, make sure the scene is safe for both you and the victim. You don't want to become a victim yourself, after all. Once you've determined it's safe, kneel down next to their chest and check if they're responsive. Tap their shoulder and ask them loudly, "Are you okay?" If there's no response, then it’s time to get them in the recovery position. First, position the arm closest to you at a right angle to their body, palm facing up. This will support their head and neck when you roll them. Then, take their other arm, fold it across their chest, and place the back of their hand against the cheek closest to you. Hold it there firmly. Next, grab their far knee with your free hand and bend it up until their foot is flat on the ground. This is your leverage point to roll them onto their side. Now, carefully pull on that bent knee to roll the person towards you. The bent arm should support their head, and the extended arm will stop them from rolling too far. Once they're on their side, adjust the bottom leg so the hip and knee are bent at right angles. This keeps them stable and prevents them from ending up on their stomach. Finally, gently tilt their head back and lift their chin to open up their airway. Check their mouth to make sure nothing is blocking it. Keep an eye on their breathing by watching their chest rise and fall. If you haven't already, call for an ambulance immediately. Grab a blanket or coat to cover them and keep them warm until help arrives. Stay with them and keep checking their breathing and responsiveness. Don't leave their side until the emergency responders take over. Remember, the recovery position is only for people who are unconscious but still breathing. If they're not breathing, call for help and start CPR straight away if you're trained to do so. The reason for putting someone in a recovery position is not comfort. It keeps their airway open, allows fluids to drain, and prevents them from choking. It gives them the best shot at survival until medical help arrives. In fact, knowing how to put someone in the recovery position could be the difference between life and death. So, pay attention, stay calm, and be ready to act if the situation demands it.

    <b><a id="commonillnesses">Responding to Common Illnesses</a></b>: <span class="summary">Manage fever, diarrhoea, and asthma attacks using appropriate methods like hydration and inhalers, while keeping a calm environment.</span> There are too many illnesses to address here, so I’m going to just speak about the big three: fever, diarrhoea, and an asthma attack. To be truly useful in matters of first aid, you must never stop learning. First, let's talk about fevers. If someone's temperature is above 38°C (that’s 100.4°F), and they're sweating, shivering, or complaining about headaches and muscle aches, you're likely dealing with a fever. Grab a thermometer to confirm this, and check for any other symptoms that could point to the cause. To help them feel better, remove any extra clothing to cool them down and keep the room well-ventilated. Encourage them to drink plenty of fluids. Not just water, but also diluted juice and oral rehydration solutions. You can also offer over-the-counter fever reducers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, but make sure to follow the dosage instructions on the package. Keep a close eye on their temperature and symptoms. If the fever doesn't go away or if they develop severe symptoms like a rash, stiff neck, confusion, or a splitting headache, then it's time to seek medical help. Next up, diarrhoea. The large intestine absorbs water. And if you’re losing a lot of it quickly through watery and frequent stools, you can get dehydrated. No, not ‘thirsty’. Dehydrated. That’s a medical condition which can lead to shock, or even a coma. So, watch out: If someone is experiencing watery stools, abdominal cramps, and possibly nausea or vomiting, then they’ve probably got diarrhoea. Notice how I say ‘probably’. That’s the best you can do in first aid. The key here is to prevent dehydration. Give them oral rehydration solutions and small, frequent sips of fluids. Watch for signs of dehydration like decreased urination, dry mouth, or dizziness. If the symptoms last more than two days or if there are signs of severe dehydration, like blood in the stool, or a high fever, that’s when you know it’s time to get medical assistance. Finally, I’m going to talk about asthma attacks. If someone's having difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, or feeling tightness in their chest, they could be having an asthma attack. Your job is to keep them calm and seated upright. Don't leave them alone. If they have a prescribed inhaler, help them use it. Two puffs of a reliever inhaler, which is usually blue, is the standard dose. If the symptoms don't improve after the initial dose, repeat the inhaler use every few minutes until medical help arrives. If the person doesn't have an inhaler, and their symptoms get worse, or they become increasingly distressed, call for emergency help immediately. These are just the basics. It’s your responsibility to always increase your education. Headaches, stomach aches, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, mononucleosis! Get busy researching these now. If you are ever unsure or the situation seems severe, don't hesitate to seek professional medical assistance.
  </p>


  <p>
    <b><a id="allergiesheatexhaustionhypothermia">Responding to Allergic Reactions, Heat Exhaustion, and Hypothermia</a></b>: <span class="summary">For an allergic reaction, use an EpiPen immediately; for heat exhaustion, cool and hydrate quickly; and for hypothermia, warm up slowly.</span> Allergic reactions, hypothermia, and heat exhaustion - these conditions can go from bad to worse in a matter of minutes. That's why you need to know how to spot the symptoms and take action fast. First up, allergic reactions. If someone's got itchy skin, hives, a stuffy nose, or they're sneezing and have watery eyes, they're likely having a mild to moderate reaction. But if you see swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, dizziness, fainting, or a rapid, weak pulse, that's anaphylaxis - a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction. In case of a severe reaction, drop everything and call emergency services immediately. If an EpiPen is available, administer it without hesitation. You should know that ‘EpiPen’ is just a trademark, and their general name is epinephrine auto-injector. Have the person lie down with their legs elevated, monitor their breathing, and be ready to perform CPR if needed. For milder reactions, an oral antihistamine can help, but keep a close eye on their symptoms. Next, let's talk about hypothermia. If someone is shivering (or has stopped shivering), has cold, pale skin, slurred speech, shallow breathing, a weak pulse, or seems confused or drowsy, they're likely hypothermic. Your priority is to get them to a warm place and out of any wet clothing. Cover them with blankets, focusing on the head and torso. Call emergency services and monitor their breathing; again, performing CPR if necessary. Finally, there's heat exhaustion. Look out for heavy sweating, cold and clammy skin, dizziness, nausea, and a rapid heartbeat. If you spot these signs, get the person to a cool place to rest. Then give them water or sports drinks to replenish fluids. Also, loosen or remove any excess clothing, and apply cool, wet cloths to their skin. If their symptoms worsen, don't wait - seek medical advice immediately. The key with all these conditions is to act fast and decisively. Don't second-guess yourself. If you think someone's in trouble, they probably are. Trust your instincts, call for help when needed, and do what you can to keep the person stable until professional help arrives.
  </p>


  <p>
    <b><a id="burncare">Providing Initial Burn Care</a></b>: <span class="summary">To treat a burn, run it under cool water for 10 to 20 minutes, cover it loosely, and monitor the person for shock.</span> All burns need medical attention. But, for a first degree burn, you can actually provide some first aid. Your job is to get them safe, cool the burn, cover it, and call for help if it’s serious. It goes without saying that you need to remove the victim from the source of the burn. Before you treat them, make sure the scene is safe. Cut away any belts, jewellery, or other tight pieces of clothing around the burn before the swelling starts. Now, you need to cool the burn. Hold it under cool running water for 10 to 20 minutes straight. Not cold water. Not ice. Not creams or greasy stuff like butter. Just cool water for 10 to 20 minutes. If you use ice, then you’re decreasing blood flow to the area, slowing the healing process. And believe it or not, if you were to hold ice there for 20 minutes straight, they’d be dealing with a burn and frostbite simultaneously. So, cool running water only. Once it's cooled, cover it loosely with a clean cloth, plastic bag, or a sterile non-sticky bandage. Don't wrap it tight. And don't put pressure on it. If the burn is on their face, neck, hands, feet, joints, or private parts, or if it's a major burn, call the emergency services immediately. I recommend looking at images of first, second, and third degree burns. In fact, stare at them until you are used to them. The last thing anyone needs in a first aid situation is squeamishness. For minor burns, leave any blisters alone after cooling. They're actually protection against infection. Keep the burn elevated above their heart to keep the swelling down. Give them some over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, but only if they need it. And watch them closely for signs of shock - if they're breathing shallow, looking pale, or fainting, that's shock and it can kill. They will need a doctor immediately. And listen. This goes for any burn on a baby or a child. If you have a burn or see a burn on someone that's large, or deep, or turns the skin charred or leathery, then get yourself or them to a doctor. Don't think twice about it.
  </p>


  <p>
    <b><a id="treatingcuts"></a>Cleaning & Treating Minor Cuts & Scrapes</b>: <span class="summary">To clean a wound, apply antibiotic ointment, cover it with a dressing, and monitor for signs of infection.</span> Do you see a cut on your skin or someone else’s? Before you touch it, wash your hands with soap and water. You don’t want to add bacteria to the wound. If it's bleeding, then stop the bleeding by applying firm and direct pressure on it by applying a clean cloth or gauze. Keep pressing for a few minutes or until the bleeding stops. Now, if the blood soaks through, add more gauze on top instead of removing the first layer. Remember: Don't take off the first layer. If the cut is on an arm or leg, raise the arm or leg above their heart. That will slow down the bleeding at least. Once the bleeding has stopped, rinse the wound under cool running water. It’s important to get the dirt and debris out of there. Now, gently clean the skin around it with mild soap and water. Avoid getting any soap directly in the wound or you’ll just irritate the area. Do you have tweezers? If yes, excellent. Clean them with alcohol and pluck out any remaining debris. Pat the area dry with a clean cloth or gauze. You should PAT your skin dry with a towel anyway, but in this case you really shouldn’t rub it. I mean, it is a fresh wound. Next, smear on a thin layer of antibiotic ointment. This will keep the wound moist and fight off infection. Cover the wound with a sterile adhesive bandage or gauze secured with tape. Change the dressing every day or whenever it gets wet or dirty. Each time, clean the wound and put on fresh ointment and a new bandage. It’s not over yet, though. You’ll have to keep an eye out for signs of infection: more pain, redness, swelling, heat, pus, or fever. If you see those, get to a doctor. And if something dirty or rusty caused the cut, make sure you get a tetanus shot within 48 hours. That’s it. Keep it clean, keep it covered, and keep watch.
  </p>


  <p>
    <b><a id="stabilisingfractures">Stabilising a Fractured Limb</a></b>: <span class="summary">To stabilise a fractured limb, immobilise it, secure it with a splint, monitor circulation, and wait for the emergency services to arrive.</span> For a fractured limb, keep it stable, keep them comfortable, and wait for emergency services. That’s the gist of it. Now, if the fracture is severe, or there's heavy bleeding, or the person is out cold, call an ambulance immediately. Don't move them unless you absolutely have to. Look for swelling, bruising, a weird shape, or bone poking through the skin. Ask them where it hurts. If there's bleeding, press a clean cloth or sterile bandage on it. But avoid pressing right on the fracture. Your job is to immobilise the joints above and below the break. If it’s bent, do not try to straighten it. And if it's sticking out, don’t push the bone back in. Take off any tight clothing or jewellery near the injury in case it swells up. Now you have to support and immobilise the limb. Use whatever you've got - cushions, rolled-up clothes, or, if you know how to, make a splint from something rigid or flexible. While you’re doing that, pad it so that it's not painful for them. Secure the splint above and below the break with bandages or strips of cloth. Make it snug but not too tight. And check that blood is still flowing past the splint. If they feel faint, get them lying down and raise their legs if you can and if you’re sure there’s not a spinal injury. They will be in a lot of pain, so keep them calm and warm to prevent shock. Wrap some cold packs in cloth and put them on the injury for pain relief, but only do so for 20 minutes at a time. Don't put ice right on their skin, otherwise they can incur a frostbite. Keep an eye on their vital signs and watch for any complications until the paramedics arrive. And even if they ask for it, don't give them anything to eat or drink in case they need surgery.
