	<b>Universe</b>: space, time & its contents. Originated ~13.8B yrs ago via Big Bang. Observable Universe is 93B LY wide; expands & accelerates due to dark energy. Pre-scientific models were Earth-centric; modern ones assert edgeless, centerless, & largely uniform universe. Lambda-CDM model asserts ~70% of mass/energy is dark energy, ~25% is dark matter, ~5% ordinary matter. Gravity coalesced early H & He gases into 1st stars. Sun is 1 of ~200B stars in Milky Way, itself 1 of ~200B galaxies in Observable Universe. Its expansion may culminate in Heat Death.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Earth</b>: 3rd planet from Sun & sole known life-host. Formed ~4.5B yrs ago via Solar System dust accretion. Earth's shape is ellipsoidal & ~12,742 km wide; structured as iron core, mantle, & crust. Atmosphere: 78% N, 21% O, & trace gases. Surface is 71% H2O in oceans & poles. Tectonic plates yield seismic activity: quakes & volcanoes. Magnetosphere, generated by liquid outer core, protects us from harmful solar winds. Moon, only natural satellite, visible via reflected sunlight. Its tilt & orbit cause seasons; axial rotation causes day-night cycle.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Life</b>: grows, reacts, adapts, reproduces, uses energy. Emerged 3.5B yrs ago, possibly from non-living matter. Cells, basic units of life, vary in form & function. Organisms range from single-celled bacteria to multicellular plants & animals. ~2M recorded species on Earth, many threatened. Diversity arises via variation & natural selection. DNA in cells encodes genetic instructions; all known life carbon-based w/ H2O as solvent. >99% of all species ever lived now extinct. Extraterrestrial life sought on Earth-like exoplanets.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Science</b>: study of nature yielding testable explanations & predictions. Branches: formal, natural, social, & applied. Revolutionised 400 yrs ago w/ heliocentric model. Scientific method: observation -> hypothesis -> experimentation. Key theories: relativity (gravity warps space-time via mass & energy), atomic theory (particles behave by probabilistic laws), evolution (species change via natural selection). Mathematical modelling links maths & science, enables numerical predictions. Key concerns: responsible research & environmental stewardship.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Technology</b>: practical application of scientific knowledge. Types: agricultural, medical, manufacturing, transport, communication. Fire control by ancestors meant cooking, warmth, & protection. Farming, 13k yrs ago, stabilised food supply, enabling civilization. Writing, 5k yrs ago, meant preservation & transgenerational transfer of knowledge. Electricity powered Industrial Revolution, both ~200 yrs ago, a shift from handcrafted to machine-made goods; now powers computing. Emerging techs incl. robotics, blockchains, AI. Key concerns: privacy, job displacement, & climate change.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Art</b>: human creative expression. Dates back ~50k yrs in visual form; likely older in singing & storytelling. Serves communication, devotion, critique, therapy. Genres & movements exist but defy full systematisation. Branches: visual, performing, literary, culinary, & applied. Creation involves subject preparation, piece crafting, & appreciation. Restoration possible if creator's intent known. Museums vital for preservation, democratisation, cultural heritage. AI's role in art creation prompts questions re: artist & future. Key concerns: appropriation, forgery, censorship.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Language</b>: communication system w/ vocab & grammar. May be 150k yrs old; origins elusive. ~7k languages exist today; 1 extinct every 2 wks. Spoken or signed, >4k written; human language is unique in discussing imaginary/absent subjects. Top languages: English, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, Mandarin. Langs evolve w/ culture via migration, isolation, trade. ~150 language families based on evolutionary lineage. Best language learning period: 0 to 7 yrs old. Key concerns: preservation & natural language processing by computers.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Humans</b>: most prevalent primate species. Originated in Africa ~300k yrs ago. Largely nomadic hunter-gatherers until Neolithic Revolution 13k yrs ago led to settlement & farming. Current pop. ~8B; >100B ever born. Bipedalism distinguishes from other great apes; highly social, forming families, kin groups, states. Social structures show diverse values, norms, and rituals. Genetically 99% identical, yet diverse in traits. Unique in abstraction, planning, empathy. Moon-visited in '69; potential for multiplanetary existence.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Civilization</b>: complex society w/ advanced infrastructure, culture, gov't. Arose independently at least 6x, esp. in Fertile Crescent. Antiquity advanced politics & philosophy. Middle ages saw religious shifts, empire expansion, scientific rigor. Modernity marked by tech-driven globalisation & digital age. ~200 sovereign states, many disputed. Legal systems mostly civil or common law, influenced by human rights. Economic systems largely market-oriented, capitalist-socialist mix. Political systems range from totalitarian to democratic, often hybrids. Global risks: climate change, WWIII, unaligned AI.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>Religion</b>: system of beliefs & practices linking humanity to spiritual elements; lacks scholarly consensus on precise definition. Religious-like rituals, like burial, date back at least 100k yrs. ~10k distinct religions globally; most small & local. 77% of populace Christian, Muslim, Hindu, or Buddhist. Hinduism, rooted in Indian subcontinent, arose 3500 yrs ago. Buddhism arose 2500 yrs ago in NE India. Christianity, largest religion, arose 2000 yrs ago in Middle East. Islam, fastest-growing, arose 1400 yrs ago in Middle East. Key concerns: extremism, pluralism, secularism.
