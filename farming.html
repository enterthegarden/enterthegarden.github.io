    Okay, green thumb. Time to farm. Collect every scrap of organic waste you can get your hands on. Coffee grounds, eggshells, banana peels — all of it. Smaller pieces decompose faster. Layer it like lasagna: browns, greens, browns, greens. It should feel as moist as a wrung-out sponge. Turn it every week until it's black gold. Your soil is your lifeblood. So, get it tested for its pH levels, and nutrient levels (N-P-K). Too acidic? Add lime. Too alkaline? Add sulphur. This is Crops 101: Tomatoes love heat; peas can't stand it. Corn sucks nitrogen dry; legumes put it back. You must rotate your crops annually or your soil’s nutrients will deplete. As for how deep to sow your seeds, it varies by crop. Tomato seeds should be a centimetre deep. And corn seeds, two centimetres deep. Space them right or they'll choke each other out. Seedlings need to toughen up before transplant. Put them outside for a few hours each day, then bring them back in. Repeat this until they're ready. Save water when you irrigate. Use drip irrigation and soaker hoses. Put the water right where it's needed, and not a drop more. You’ve also got to mulch. 10 centimetres deep, minimum. Straw, wood chips, leaves — pick one and mulch. Mulch locks in moisture and keeps the weeds at bay. The results vary, but try companion planting. Corn with beans. Carrots with onions. Tomatoes with marigolds. The idea is to attract good bugs to eat the bad ones. Scout your crops for trouble daily. Holes in the leaves? Kill the caterpillars. Powdery mildew? Prune the infected parts. Catch it early or you’ll lose. When it’s time to harvest, it varies by crop. Pick tomatoes when they’re firm, but not fully ripe. Dig up potatoes when the plant tops begin to die back. And beans when the pods are firm. Your Tools are your weapons. Hoe, spade, trowel, pruners. Keep them sharp enough to shave with. Oil them. Clean them. Store them. Never stop learning, too. Go to county extension workshops. Experiment. Fail. Try and try again. Embrace the dirt, sweat, and glory.

  <b><i>Further Notes...</i></b>
</div>

  <div class="story">


  <p>
    <b><a id="composting">Composting</a></b>: Choose dry, shady spot near H2O for pile/bin. Set up bin/pile based on space & needs. Balance green (N-rich) & brown (C-rich) waste, 1:2-3 ratio. Cut/shred large pieces to speed decomp. Keep moist like wrung sponge, water if needed. Turn pile every 1-2 wks w/ fork/aerator for O2 & speed. Monitor temp, should reach 130-150°F (54-66°C) in center. Add materials regularly, cover food w/ brown layer. Ready when dark, crumbly, no original materials (2 mo. - 1 yr). Use mature compost to enrich garden, pots, or lawn.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b><a id="fertilising">Fertilising</a></b>: Test soil for nutrients, pH & deficiencies to select right fertilizer type & amount. Choose fertilizer based on soil test & plant needs. Consider N-P-K ratio. Read label for rates, timing & precautions. Follow instructions. Determine best time based on plant type, growth stage & climate. Avoid extreme heat/drought. Calculate amount needed based on area size & label rate. Apply granular evenly w/ spreader in pattern. For liquid, use can/sprayer & mix per label. Water after applying unless rain expected to distribute nutrients & prevent burn. Monitor plants for deficiency/excess signs like yellowing, stunting, leaf burn. Adjust as needed. Record date, type & amount used to track progress & inform future applications. Store unused in cool, dry place away from kids & pets. Keep in original labeled container.

  </p>

  <p>
    <b><a id="companionplanting">Companion Planting</a></b>: Learn companion planting principles: pest control, nutrient enhancement, shade/support, attracting pollinators. Choose compatible plant combinations using companion planting charts. Consider plant size, growth habits, & spacing to maximize space/resources. Plan garden layout, sketch beds, & incorporate companion planting principles. Prepare soil: well-draining, nutrient-rich, add compost/organic matter as needed. Plant strategically, follow recommended spacing, interplant companions closely. Use aromatic herbs/flowering plants to attract beneficial insects, repel pests, & improve garden health. Provide support structures (trellises/stakes) for climbing plants. Monitor plants for pests, diseases, nutrient deficiencies; address issues promptly using organic methods. Keep a garden journal to record observations, successes, & challenges; refine strategies over time. Practice crop rotation annually to prevent nutrient depletion & break pest/disease cycles.

  </p>

  <p>
    <b><a id="seedsowing">Seed Sowing</a></b>: Choose right seeds for climate & season. Consider local varieties for adaptability & pest/disease resistance. Prep soil or clean container w/ drainage holes (seed trays, pots, recycled). Fill w/ high-quality, well-draining seed starting mix. Moisten mix evenly, damp not soggy. Sow seeds at recommended depth (2-3x seed width). Some need light, sow on surface. Press seeds gently into mix for good contact. Water gently to moisten w/o washing away seeds. Use fine spray. Provide adequate light once germinated. Bright, sunny spot or grow lights. Keep mix consistently moist, not waterlogged. Thin seedlings at true leaves to prevent overcrowding or transplant to individual pots. Harden off seedlings before transplanting outdoors. Gradually expose over 7-14 days.

  </p>


  <p>
    <b><a id="transplanting">Transplanting</a></b>: Choose cool, overcast day to minimize plant stress. Water thoroughly before to keep root ball intact & reduce shock. Prep new hole before digging up plant, ensure wide enough for roots. Carefully dig up, preserve root ball. Inspect roots, loosen if bound, trim damaged. Place in new hole at same depth. Backfill w/ soil, press firmly to remove air pockets & ensure root-to-soil contact. Water deeply & slowly immediately after to settle soil. Add organic mulch for moisture & temp regulation. Provide temp shade/protection if hot, sunny, windy to reduce stress. Monitor regularly after, ensure consistently moist not waterlogged soil. Watch for stress/poor health signs.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b><a id="irrigating">Irrigating</a></b>: Assess soil type & water-holding capacity. Sandy soils drain fast & need frequent, light watering; clay soils retain more & need less. Use water-saving methods like drip irrigation/micro-sprinklers to deliver water to roots, minimizing evaporation & runoff. Schedule based on crop needs & weather. Irrigate during cooler times (early morning/evening) to reduce evaporation. Maintain system regularly. Check for leaks, clogs, damage & repair promptly for efficiency. Use mulch to reduce evaporation, moderate soil temp & suppress weeds. Collect & store rainwater w/ cisterns, tanks, ponds for supplemental source during dry periods. Use soil moisture sensors/weather-based controllers to monitor levels & automate based on real-time conditions to prevent over/under-watering. Continuously educate & adapt practices. Stay informed on new tech, best practices & sustainable methods for your context.

  </p>

  <p>
    <b><a id="pestweedcontrol">Pest & Weed Control</a></b>: Mulch to suppress weeds & retain moisture. Companion plant to repel pests & enhance growth. Attract beneficial insects w/ flowers & herbs. Rotate crops to disrupt weed/pest cycles in soil. Use barriers (row covers, nets) to block pests. Remove weeds manually (pull, hoe, solarize). Apply organic pesticides (neem, soaps, homemade) if needed. Monitor regularly for early detection & prevention.

  </p>

  <p>
    <b><a id="croprotating">Crop Rotating</a></b>: Divide garden into sections & rotate crops yearly. Group crops into families: legumes, brassicas, nightshades, alliums, roots. Create a 3-4 year rotation plan for crop families. Rotate by plant family, not specific crop. Avoid planting same family in same spot 2 years in a row to prevent nutrient depletion & disease/pest buildup. Use cover crops between rotations to replenish soil nutrients & organic matter. Keep records of crop family locations to track rotations. Adjust rotation plan based on garden size, layout, & specific pest/disease issues.

  </p>



  <p>
    <b><a id="harvesting">Harvesting</a></b>: Know physical signs of readiness: color, size, firmness, moisture. Track days since planting vs. "days to maturity." Harvest at optimal times: morning for leafy greens, later for fruits (e.g., tomatoes, melons). Avoid harvesting wet crops (dew, rain, irrigation) to prevent decay/fungal growth. Use clean, sharp tools to avoid plant damage. Handle produce gently to minimize bruising/damage. Move crops out of sun/heat quickly to prevent decay. Clean/dry crops before storing in cool, dark places. Cure some (e.g., onions, squash) in warm, airy spots. Continuously learn/adapt techniques & stay informed on best practices.

  </p>

  <p>
    <b><a id="farmtoolrepairing">Farm Tool Repairing</a></b>: Clean tools after each use to remove dirt, debris, & moisture (prevents rust/corrosion). Sharpen blades regularly w/ file, whetstone, or grinder (better performance, less strain). Oil/lubricate moving parts (hinges, springs, chains) to minimize friction/wear. Tighten/replace loose/damaged parts. Check & tighten screws, bolts, fasteners. Replace broken handles, guards, etc. Protect wooden handles by sanding rough spots & coating w/ linseed oil (prevents splintering/decay). Store tools properly in an organized, dry place. Hang/place securely to prevent damage. Inspect tools before use for damage, improper alignment, or needed adjustment/repair. Use the right tool for the job. Avoid makeshift uses that can damage tools. Avoid improper modifications (unsafe, prone to breakage). Follow manufacturer's recommendations. Perform routine maintenance regularly (clean, lubricate, sharpen, tighten, tune up). Fix/replace damaged tools promptly to avoid unsafe conditions/further damage.
