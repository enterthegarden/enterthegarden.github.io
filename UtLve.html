      <br>Love regards the Bonds of People.
      <br>Utmost Love regards the Creation of People.
      <br>This is Lifebuilding <span class="arealabel">(LfB)</span>.
      <br>
      <br><b>For People, this so often begins with Relations</b> <span class="arealabel">(New)</span><b>.</b>
      <br>
      <br>For any relations at all, be ready.
      <br>Ready in your Body, in your Mind, and in your Soul.
      <br>These differ and have differed as much as People differ and have differed.
      <br>But, what is the same is the need for Inmost Love.
      <br>
      <br>Then for intimacy with each other, be ready in your Hearts.
      <br>Love one another as you have learned to love yourself.
      <br>Relations can bring a new life, so be ready for a new life.
      <br>Whatever has happened to you, whatever will happen to you, 
      <br>You are always worthy of Goodness.
      <br>
      <br><b>And eventually, this so often couples with Nurturing</b> <span class="arealabel">(Nur)</span><b>.</b>
      <br>
      <br>Care for who you nurture.
      <br>Stay together and be each other’s family.
      <br>
      <br><b>Provide</b> them their needs; their food, their clothing, and their shelter.
      <br>But, encourage their strength to provide for themselves.
      <br>
      <br><b>Teach</b> them the universe; read together and play together.
      <br>But, encourage their curiosity so that they may teach themselves.
      <br>
      <br><b>Love</b> them dearly; hug them, listen to them, and give them a home.
      <br>But, let them learn to love themselves.
      <br>So they can rightly love their family and the wider world.
      <br>
      <br><b>Cherish</b> them, however they appear; and have no favourites.
      <br>But, encourage their self expression so that they may cherish themselves.
      <br>
      <br><b>Guide</b> them by the example of your character.
      <br>Be fair; but, be forgiving.
      <br>It will be difficult. Have patience.
      <br><b>Stay together.</b>
