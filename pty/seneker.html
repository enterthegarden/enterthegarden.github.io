        <h1>Letter I,</h1>
        <h2><span title="Arenilitic">Sandstone</span> Butte, <span title="Occident">West</span></h2>
        <h3>November 4, 1872</h3>

        <p>Most <span title="Sophomorical">Juvenile</span> Sir:-

        <p>Your <span title="Graeco-Latin">Greek-like and Latin-like</span> <span title="epistolet">little letter</span> or <span title="cabalistical">mystical</span> <span title="abracadabra">nonsense</span>, lies before me <span title="deciphered">decoded</span> and <span title="eclaircised">clarified</span> to the best of my linguistic, <span title="pasigraphical">universally understandable writing</span>, and <span title="exegetical">critically explanatory</span> abilities. As a <span title="merited">well deserved</span> <span title="castigation">verbal reprimand</span> <span title="therefor">for that</span>, and to test your <span title="wonted">accustomed</span> <span title="longanimity">good-natured tolerance</span>, I shall <span title="recalcitrate">vigorously oppose</span> by <span title="effunding">pouring out</span> upon you, in <span title="epistolic">letter-like</span> form, my <span title="scaturient">overflowing</span> <span title="cornucopia">abundance</span> of <span title="lexiphanic">pretentious</span> <span title="sesquipedalities">long words</span>, <span title="Johsonian">Johnson-era</span> <span title="archaisms">old words</span>, <span title="exoticisms">foreign words</span>, <span title="neologianisms">invented words</span>, <span title="pativinities">local and provincial words</span>, <span title="et id genus omne">and all of that kind</span>.

        <p>In former <span title="epistolary">letter-like</span> <span title="scribblements">scribbles</span>, I gave you the <span title="concatenation">string</span> of <span title="concomitant">accompanying</span> circumstances <span title="initiatory">motion-starting</span> to my <span title="transmigration">migration</span> to this remote section of the <span title="occidental">western</span> portions of our columbian republican <span title="coadunation">union</span>. I have also <span title="delineated">precisely outlined</span> my <span title="periculous">dangerous</span> adventures among the <span title="fucated">painted</span>, <span title="rubicund">red-faced</span> <span title="autochthons">original inhabitants</span>, or aborigines; portrayed various incidents of <span title="venations">huntings</span> in which I participated, <span title="minorating">reducing</span> <span title="gregal">flocked</span> <span title="aggregations">gatherings</span> of bison and <span title="antilocapridae">prong-horned animals</span> which abound on the <span title="gramineous">grassy</span>, <span title="occiduous">western</span> plateaus; depicted my primal vision of the <span title="illusive">deceiving</span> <span title="phenomenal">extraordinary</span> mirage, and the fata morgana; and in <span title="verity">truth</span>, recounted much of my <span title="vicissitudinous">fluctuating in fortune</span> experience whilst with the caravan traversing the <span title="occidental">western</span> <span title="champaigns">extensive tracts of level and open land</span>.

        <p>I am, however, not <span title="oblivious">unaware</span> of the fact, that when we imparted mutual <span title="valedictory">departing</span> <span title="conges">goodbyes</span>, I laid myself under obligations to give you <span title="a pantographical">an all-encompassing</span> <span title="delineation">precise outline</span> of the <span title="ponent">western</span> regions upon which I might cast my <span title="ophthalmic organs">eyes</span>. As it would be a <span title="dilucid">clear</span> <span title="evagation">wandering</span> from my <span title="accustomary">usual</span> <span title="routinism">mechanical regularity</span> to <span title="comperendinate">delay</span> the fulfillment of my <span title="pollicitations">promises</span> by procrastination or <span title="dereliction">abandonment</span>, I shall, deeming this a <span title="suffisance">sufficient thing</span>, <span title="proemially">prefacing</span>, or <span title="prolegominarily">preliminarily</span>, <span title="essay">attempt</span> to further <span title="exonerate">disburden</span> myself of said obligations, and <span title="imprimis">in the first place</span> give you a <span title="chorographical">geographically descriptive</span> sketch of this part of our <span title="hesperian">western</span> domain, and a <span title="compendiarious">comprehensive and concise</span> <span title="enumeration">ordered listing</span> of its <span title="autochthonal">native</span> <span title="flora">plants</span> and <span title="fauna">animals</span>.

        <p>The <span title="superficies">surface features</span> of the <span title="occidental">western</span> portion are <span title="diversified">made diverse</span> by many <span title="altitudinarian">lofty</span>, <span title="terrene">earthly</span>, <span title="lapidarious">stony</span>, and <span title="rupellary">rocky</span> <span title="acroceraunian">thunder-smitten</span> <span title="montanic elevations">mountains</span>. Some of <span title="cyclopean">gigantic</span> <span title="vastidity">immensity</span>, and <span title="sublime">perfect</span> <span title="scabredity">roughness</span>. Their <span title="mirificent">wonderful</span> <span title="glacious">icy</span> <span title="pinnacles">peaks</span> tower, apparently above the <span title="nubiferous">cloudy</span> regions, into the <span title="caliginous">dark</span> <span title="empyrean">highest heavens</span>.

        <p>The <span title="oriental">eastern</span> portion is a vast <span title="undulating">wavy</span> plateau; extremely <span title="longitudinal">long</span> and <span title="latitudinous">wide</span>; having few <span title="exiguous">meager</span> <span title="dingles">valleys</span>. Its <span title="terreous">earthy</span> surface is covered with a most nutritious <span title="autochthonous">native</span> <span title="xerophilous">dry-weather-thriving</span> <span title="graminaceous">grassy</span> growth; principally, bouteloua oligostachya, tripsacum dactyloides, mesquite, and gramma. This growth sustains <span title="equine">horse</span>, <span title="bovine">cow</span>, <span title="hircine">goat</span>, and <span title="ovine">sheep</span> <span title="quadrupeds">four-legged animals</span> in a state of <span title="rotund">plump</span> <span title="impinguation">fattening</span> during the entire <span title="hiemal">wintry</span> season. Artemisia tridentata, the <span title="solisequious">sun-following</span> <span title="helianthus">sunflowers</span>, <span title="aculeated">prickled</span> cactus opuntia, and <span title="multifarious">diverse</span> <span title="succulent">fleshy-leaved</span> <span title="acanthaceous">prickle-bearing</span> and <span title="aciculated">needle-bearing</span> <span title="cactaceous">cactus-like</span> <span title="plantage">herbs</span>, and <span title="floriferous">flower-bearing</span>, <span title="herbaceous">herb-like</span>, and <span title="graminifolious">grass-like-leaved</span> <span title="garniture">decorations</span> <span title="luxuriate">enjoy luxury</span> in many <span title="localities">areas and neighbourhoods</span>.

        <p>The <span title="fluvial">river</span> <span title="meanders">winding courses</span> are limited, and originate from the <span title="liquefaction">liquifying</span> of vast <span title="niveous">snowy</span> and <span title="glacial">icy</span> accumulations in the <span title="montanic">mountainous</span> regions. None are <span title="navigerous">ship-bearing</span>, but they are <span title="truttaceous">full of trout</span> and <span title="anatiferous">duck-bearing</span>. Some are <span title="pactolian">golden</span>, and all extremely <span title="relucent">glittering</span>, and possess a great degree of <span title="diaphaneity">transparency</span>. None tardy in <span title="profluence">onward flow</span>. At many points, their <span title="rivages">coasts</span>, especially in the <span title="vicinity">neighbourhood</span> of <span title="embouchures">river mouths</span>, or <span title="disemboguements">dischargings</span> of <span title="arroyos">watercourses</span>, are <span title="replete">full</span> with a <span title="promiscuity">mixture</span> of <span title="asperifolious">rough-leaved</span>, <span title="bacciferous, or cocciferous">berry-bearing</span>, <span title="vinaceous">vine-like</span>, <span title="arundinaceous">reed-like</span>, and other <span title="bushments">clusters of bushes</span>.

        <p><span title="Myriads">Masses</span> of <span title="venene">poisonous</span>, <span title="umbelliferous">umbel-bearing</span>, <span title="corymbiferous">corymb-bearing</span>, <span title="racemiferous">raceme-bearing</span>, <span title="urticaceous">nettle-bearing</span>, <span title="fructiferous">fruit-bearing</span>, <span title="anthophorous, or floriferous">flower-bearing</span> <span title="plantage">plants</span>, and <span title="multifarious">varied</span> <span title="spontaneous">uncultivated</span> <span title="esculent">edible</span> products also abound. The <span title="autochthonous">native</span> <span title="arboreous">woody</span> growth consists of <span title="acerose">needled</span> <span title="sempervirent">evergreen</span> and <span title="perdifolious">deciduous</span> <span title="silva">forests</span>, and <span title="boscages">groves</span>. By no means, of <span title="immane">huge</span> <span title="arduity">steepness</span>, or totally <span title="devoid of">without</span> <span title="aduncities">crooks</span>, <span title="nodosities">knots</span>, and <span title="knags">pointed rocks</span>. <span title="Disboscation">Deforestation</span> by <span title="succision">cutting down trees</span> and <span title="conflagrations">large fires</span> will deplete same in the next decade.

        <p>The <span title="reptatory">creeping</span>, <span title="pennigerous">feathered</span>, <span title="bisulcous">cloven-hoofed</span> and <span title="unguiculated">clawed</span> <span title="feral">wild</span> <span title="entities">beings</span> of this domain are; <span title="ousels">blackbirds</span>, <span title="ptarmigans">partridges</span>, <span title="ortolans">small birds</span>, <span title="leverocks">larks</span>, <span title="trochidae">humming birds</span>, <span title="shelducks">wild ducks</span>, <span title="cryals">herons</span>, <span title="kokobs">venomous serpents</span>, <span title="creeples">creeping reptiles</span>, <span title="crotaluses">diamond rattlesnakes</span>, <span title="carcajous">wolverines</span>, <span title="logomyes">hares</span>, <span title="castors">beavers</span>, <span title="marmots">woodchucks</span>, <span title="malodorous">bad smelling</span> <span title="mariputs">polecats</span>, <span title="spilogale putorius">skunks</span>, <span title="lepus campestris">hares</span>, <span title="oves montanoe">mountain sheep</span>, <span title="antilocapridae">antelope</span>, bison, <span title="spermophiles">ground squirrels</span>, coyotes, <span title="grizzlies-ursus horribilis">grizzly bears</span>, and other animals of the <span title="murine">mouse</span>, <span title="sciurine">squirrel</span>, <span title="feline">cat</span>, <span title="canine">dog</span>, <span title="leporine">rabbit</span>, <span title="vulpine">fox</span>, <span title="lupine">wolf</span>, <span title="ursine">bear</span>, <span title="cervine">deer</span>, <span title="caprine">goat</span>, <span title="ovine">sheep</span>, and <span title="equine">horse</span> genera. Also, <span title="pennipotent">strong-winged</span> <span title="accipitrine">hawk-like</span> and <span title="aquiline">eagle-like</span> <span title="raptors">birds of prey</span>. There are apparently <span title="interminable">unending</span> areas almost wholly <span title="monopolized">dominated</span> by <span title="cynomys ludovicianus">prairie dogs</span>. Viewing the <span title="ludicrous">laughable</span> antics of these <span title="lusory">playful</span> <span title="sciurine">squirrel-like</span> burrowing rodents, in their <span title="circumcursations">running abouts</span>, or perched, <span title="a la homo">like a man</span> upon the <span title="apices">peaks</span> of their <span title="coniform">cone-shaped</span> <span title="tumulosities">mounds</span> <span title="incessitously">ceaselessly</span> <span title="allatrating">barking</span>, one cannot control his <span title="risibles">laughter muscles</span>.

        <p>The <span title="intermontane">between-mountain</span> sections of this region are as <span title="auriferous">gold-bearing</span> and <span title="argentiferous">silver-bearing</span> as any of the <span title="austral">southern</span>, remote <span title="austrine occidental">south-western</span>, or extreme <span title="occidental">western</span> and <span title="septentrional">northern</span> sections of this republican <span title="adunation">union</span>. They are also <span title="ferriferous">iron-bearing</span>, <span title="carboniferous">carbon-bearing</span>, or <span title="anthraciferous">anthracite-bearing</span>, <span title="plumbiferous">lead-bearing</span>, and <span title="cupriferous">copper-bearing</span>.

        <p>The <span title="uberty or fecundity">fruitfulness</span> of the soil in the <span title="battable">fertile</span> sections, when properly <span title="stercorated">manured</span> and <span title="irrigated">watered</span>, <span title="exuperates">excels</span> <span title="enarration">exposition</span>. Besides <span title="frumentarious">wheaty and grainy</span> products - which yield a most <span title="siliginose">fine wheat</span> flour - there are produced in <span title="campestrian">open field</span> and <span title="olitory">kitchen garden</span> enclosures; <span title="brank">buckwheat</span>, <span title="citruls">pumpkins</span>, <span title="sarmentaceous">sarment-bearing</span> <span title="fragaria">strawberries</span>, <span title="cucurbitaceous">cucumber-like</span>, <span title="acetarious">salad-like</span>, <span title="fabaceous">bean-like</span>, and, in <span title="verity">truth</span>, <span title="multifarious">very varied</span> <span title="oleraceous">herby</span> <span title="edibles">foods</span>.

        <p>There are vast <span title="arid">very dry</span> <span title="alkaligenous">alkaline</span> areas, and <span title="arenarious">sandy</span> <span title="aggerations">heaps</span>, <span title="multitudinous">innumerable</span> <span title="conglomerate">clustered</span> buttes, and <span title="circumdenudated">washed-bare</span> <span title="arenilitic">sandstone</span> elevations. Such areas not being <span title="scaturiginous">full of springs</span>, and <span title="arable">suitable for crops</span>, will ever be sparsely populated.

        <p>The <span title="nummulary">money-related</span> <span title="majoration">enlargement</span>, or <span title="crescive">increasing</span> <span title="ditation">enrichment</span> of the <span title="terre tenants">land tenants</span> originates from <span title="agistment">taking in of livestock for grazing</span>, <span title="coemption">entire purchasing</span> and <span title="vendition">selling</span> of <span title="equine">horse</span>, <span title="bovine">cow</span> and <span title="lanigerous">wool-bearing</span> <span title="ovine">sheep-like</span> <span title="quadrupeds">four-legged aimals</span>, or <span title="rotherbeasts">ox</span> from attention to <span title="geoponics">scientific agriculture</span>; from <span title="usurarious">exorbitant-interest-charging</span> contracts and usufructuary holdings; from enhancement in value of preempted <span title="terra firma">land</span>; from <span title="venations">huntings</span>, <span title="agiotage">currency exchange charging</span>, mining, <span title="emporetical">mercantile</span> pursuits, or <span title="mercature">commerce</span>, and from general negotiations.

        <p>The <span title="paucity">fewness</span> of population in some <span title="localities">areas and neighbourhoods</span> <span title="possesses">has</span> a <span title="consimilitude">resemblance</span> to a mere <span title="exiguity">meagreness</span>.

        <p>The life of many is <span title="bucolic">pleasantly pastoral</span> and <span title="nomadic">wandering</span>. In the <span title="oppidan">townsman</span> and many <span title="villatic">village</span> communities the <span title="optimity">best state</span> of society prevails. However, the <span title="cordial">hearty</span> <span title="compagination">union</span> of so <span title="heterogenous">mixed</span> a mass, and <span title="farraginous">miscellaneous</span> <span title="concurrence">simultaneous occurrence</span> of all nationalities, as is the case in some localities, demands time. There must be a prior <span title="detruncation">lopping off</span> of <span title="truculence">aggressiveness</span> and <span title="inurbanity">bad manners</span> of some of its divisions to obtain the <span title="optimity">best state</span> of society and <span title="secundation">prosperity</span>. <span title="Appetition">Desire</span> for <span title="aucupation">birdcatching</span>, <span title="cynegetics">hunting with dogs</span>, <span title="alectryomachy">cockfighting</span>, <span title="tauromachy">bullfighting</span>, and <span title="circumforaneous">roundabout</span> <span title="evagations">rovings</span>, must undergo <span title="imminution">a decrease</span>. The <span title="comportance">behaviour</span> of the major portion of the <span title="occidental">western</span> <span title="leod">people</span> is, by no means, <span title="truculent">defiant</span>, <span title="scelestic">wicked</span>, or <span title="immorigerous">rude</span>, nevertheless, many are <span title="subdolous">crafty</span>, and have a great <span title="inhiation">craving</span> for <span title="captation">catching favor</span>, <span title="feneration">usury</span>, the <span title="coacervation">heaping together</span> of <span title="pelf">ill-gotten money</span>, <span title="preemption">premature purchase</span> and <span title="coemption">entire purchase</span> of <span title="terra firma">land</span>, and participating in <span title="festal">festive</span> <span title="jovialities">jollities</span>.

        <p>The ethics of many are greatly <span title="maculated">stained</span> by the <span title="vendition">selling</span> and <span title="bibacity">drinking</span> of <span title="aqua vitae">strong intoxicants</span>. Localities <span title="replete">full</span> with <span title="cades">kegs</span> of <span title="aguardiente">course Spanish brandy</span>, <span title="pupelo">cider brandy</span>, <span title="skink">drink</span> and <span title="bub">alcoholic malt liquor</span>, are <span title="patrocinated">supported</span> by, and <span title="thronged">crowded</span> with <span title="bibbers">tipplers</span>, whose <span title="comates">companions</span>, <span title="condisciples">fellow students</span> and <span title="compotators">drinking partners</span> are <span title="dolts">idiots</span>, <span title="fanfarons">braggarts</span>, <span title="jobbernowls">blockheads</span>, <span title="anserous">silly</span> nincompoops, <span title="maudlin">drunkenly sentimental</span> <span title="gaberlunzies">wandering beggars</span>, <span title="temulent">drunken</span> <span title="wantwits">fools</span>, <span title="linguacious">talkative</span> <span title="borachios">drunkards</span>, and <span title="bateful">contentious</span> <span title="barrators">harassing litigators</span>.

        <p>They sometimes <span title="initiate">begin</span> their <span title="saturnalian">boisterous</span> <span title="revelries">festivities</span> with <span title="xerophagy">restrictive religious diets</span>, and the <span title="manducation">eating</span> of <span title="ragouts">meat vegetable stews</span>, <span title="saveloy">seasoned pork sausage</span>, and <span title="polony">partly cooked sausage meat</span>, to give <span title="an acumen">a keenness</span> to their <span title="gusto">enthusiasm</span> for the <span title="imbibition">drinking</span> of <span title="inebriating">intoxicating</span> <span title="potations">alcoholic drinks</span>. As a sequence, what <span title="stultiloquence">babble</span>! What random <span title="tentations">guessing attempts</span> at the <span title="enodation">solution</span> of some vulgar <span title="enigma">puzzle</span>! What <span title="perpotation">excessive drinking</span> and <span title="ruinous">destructive</span> <span title="ebriety">drunkenness</span>! What mutual <span title="pugnacity">aggressiveness</span> issuing in <span title="testy">bad-tempered</span> <span title="concertations">strifes</span> and <span title="sanguinary">bloody</span> <span title="pugilisms">fist fights</span>! Such <span title="rendezvous">meetings</span> are <span title="terrestrial">earthly</span> <span title="pandemoniums">places where demons live</span>.

        <p>Relative to myself; as you are <span title="cognizant">aware</span>, and for some time <span title="subsequent">succeeding</span> to my <span title="discession">departure</span> from home, I <span title="sojourned">temporarily stayed</span> with <span title="agnations">paternal kinsmen</span> and <span title="cognations">maternal kinsmen</span>, who are <span title="amnicolists">near-river dwellers</span> and engaged in <span title="terraculture, or agricolation">agriculture</span>. The <span title="circumambient and circumjacent">surrounding</span> country is <span title="interamnian">between rivers</span>, <span title="nemorous">full of trees and groves</span>, and <span title="paludal, or palustral">marshy</span>. My <span title="vocation">job</span> was at first, <span title="subtegulaneous">indoors</span> and <span title="sedentary">stationary</span>, but <span title="subsequently">afterwards</span> became wholly <span title="extraforaneous">outdoors</span>. Prior to becoming <span title="inured">accustomed</span> to a <span title="castrensial">camping</span> mode of life, I very <span title="injudiciously">unwisely</span> submitted to <span title="humicubations">lying on the ground</span> during <span title="pernoctations">overnight stays</span>; which during the initial part of my <span title="castrametations">camping out</span>, and <span title="alfresco">outdoor</span> employment, in connection with <span title="nocturnal">nightly</span> <span title="irrorations">sprinklings with dew</span>, <span title="miasmatic">poisonous</span> <span title="exhalations">vapours</span>, and <span title="dankishness">dampness</span> of the atmosphere, generated by a want of <span title="apricity">sunbathing</span>, were extremely <span title="febrifacient">fever-inducing</span>; causing <span title="tertiary">every third day</span> <span title="quassation">shaking</span> and <span title="febriculosity">feverishness</span>. <span title="Infrigidation">Chilling</span>, <span title="formication">a creeping sensation</span>, <span title="cardialgy">heartburn</span>, <span title="allotriophagy">strange food cravings</span>, and <span title="wamble">nausea</span>, succeeded by <span title="calenture">tropical delirious fever</span>, found entrance into my <span title="corporeal">bodily</span> organization. I was <span title="medicamentally">medicinally</span> <span title="adjuvated">helped</span> by a <span title="rurigenous">country-born</span> <span title="charlatanical">quackish</span> <span title="anencephalous">brainless</span> <span title="medicaster">pretending doctor</span>, who, not being extra <span title="scient">knowledgeable</span> in <span title="acology">the science of remedies</span>, <span title="iamatology">the science of therapeutics</span>, <span title="soteriology">the science of salvation</span>, <span title="pharmacodynamics">the science of drugs</span> and in the <span title="impartation">imparting</span> of <span title="eccritics">discharge remedies</span>, <span title="ecphrastics">purgatives</span>, and other <span title="pharmacons">drugs</span>, and moreover, having erroneously <span title="diagnosticated">diagnosed</span> my case, greatly <span title="minorated">lessened</span> my <span title="eupepsy">good digestion</span>, and <span title="occasioned">caused</span> me to spend many <span title="insomnious">sleepless</span> nights.

        <p>In my brief <span title="swevens">dreams</span> I endured <span title="circumvolation">flying arounds</span> of <span title="pigwidgeons">fairies</span>, <span title="cacodemons">evil spirits</span>, and <span title="odible">hateful</span> <span title="simulachres">phantoms</span> in my <span title="harns">brain</span>. Upon these <span title="supervened">came about</span> <span title="cynorexia">dog-like appetite</span>, <span title="leucophlegmacy">oedematous cold sweats</span>, <span title="turgid">swollen</span> <span title="muns">jaws</span>, and <span title="cinchonism">quinine deafness</span>. I am now robust physically and sane mentally, or <span title="mens sana in corpora sano">a healthy mind in a healthy body</span>, with the exception of a slight <span title="odontalgia">toothache</span> and <span title="cephalalgia">headache</span>, but not the slightest symptom of <span title="nostalgia">homesickness</span>. <span title="Eulogium">Great praise</span> to the <span title="supermundane">above-world</span> powers for the <span title="revivification">restoration</span> of my physical organization, and for my <span title="invalescence">strength</span> and complete <span title="analepsis">recovery</span> by means of <span title="antipyretics">fever medicines</span>, <span title="cholagogics">liver medicines</span>, <span title="peptics">digestion medicines</span>, <span title="anticausotics">burning fever medicines</span>, and other <span title="medicaments">medicines</span>; also, <span title="balneotherapy">disease treatments by bathing</span>, <span title="kinesipathy, or kinesiatrics">disease treatments by muscular movements</span>, and <span title="migration">movement</span> to this <span title="salubrious">healthy</span> <span title="clime">climate</span>.

        <p>Since my <span title="ubication">occupancy</span> here, my functions have been <span title="bibliopolistical">book-selling</span>, <span title="bucolical">herding</span>, <span title="agronomical">farming</span>, <span title="paideutical">teaching</span>, and <span title="negotiatory">negotiations</span>. I have <span title="pererrated">wandered</span> the <span title="ponent">west</span> regions quite extensively, and have witnessed many <span title="peregrinities">strange things</span>, and <span title="neoteric">new</span> <span title="occurrences">happenings</span>.

        <p>I will now <span title="terminate">end</span> this <span title="protracted">drawn out</span>, <span title="autoschediastical">offhand</span> <span title="scribblement">scribbling</span> by <span title="imparting">bestowing</span> to you the <span title="verity">truth</span>, that as yet, <span title="feminality">womanliness</span> has not <span title="parlously">dangerously</span> <span title="effascinated">bewitched</span> me, though I am not by any means, a <span title="misogynist">woman hater</span> or a <span title="misogamist">marriage hater</span>; affected with neither <span title="gyneolatry">adoration of women</span> or <span title="gynephobia">fear of women</span>; thought somewhat of a <span title="philogynist">friend of women</span>. <span title="Desiderating">Desiring</span> not to be <span title="gyved">shackled</span> with <span title="connubial">marital</span> relations, I have come to the <span title="illation">conclusion</span> to be <span title="solivagant">wandering alone</span> yet many <span title="annuary epochs">years</span>.

        <p>I shall offer no <span title="exculpation">defense</span> for <span title="hieroglyphical">difficult to read</span> <span title="chirography">handwriting</span>, <span title="autoschediastical">offhand</span> <span title="orthology">use of words</span>, <span title="cacography">bad spellings</span> and <span title="cacology">bad choice of words</span>; but leaving it to you to <span title="decipher">decode</span>, <span title="etymologize">find the derivations of</span>, and <span title="eclaircize">clarify</span>, to the best of your <span title="lexigraphical">word-defining</span>, <span title="lexicological">word-using</span>, <span title="orismological">technical-term-treating</span>, and <span title="philological">language history and development</span> abilities.

        <h1>Letter II,</h1>
        <h2>Mirage Plateau, <span title="Occident">West</span></h2>
        <h3>Dec. 3, 1872</h3>


        <p>Most <span title="Automathic">Self-taught</span> and <span title="Glottological">Language-knowing</span> Sir:

        <p>In my <span title="prevenient">previous</span> <span title="catachrestical">far-fetched</span> <span title="epistolographical">letter-like</span> <span title="missive">written message</span>, I <span title="essayed">tried</span> to portray to you the <span title="chorography">local geography</span> of the portion of the <span title="ponent">western</span> regions. My present <span title="elucubration">night time composition</span> shall be <span title="narratory">story-telling</span> of incidents in my <span title="chequered">uncertain</span> experience here.

        <p>The caravan with which I <span title="traversed">travelled</span> the <span title="occidental">western</span> <span title="plateau">high plain</span>, reached its destination during the <span title="canicular">dog</span> days. Here, <span title="subsequent to">following</span> the <span title="tarriance">delay</span> of several <span title="hebdomads">weeks</span>, having <span title="an appetency">a strong desire</span> to <span title="perlustrate">travel for survey</span> the <span title="Hesperian">western</span> domain still further, I entered into a <span title="pactitious">pact settled</span> agreement as <span title="peripatetic">nomadic</span> <span title="itinerant">habitually travelling</span> <span title="bibliopole">bookseller</span>.

        <p>This was quite <span title="consentaneous">suitable</span> with my nature; for, as you know, from my earliest <span title="juvenility">youth</span>, I have been <span title="an ardent">a passionate</span> <span title="bibliophilist">book lover</span>.

        <p>Receiving a <span title="compendiarious">shortened and abridged</span> <span title="prospectus">summary</span>, I <span title="prolated">uttered</span> <span title="valedictions">goodbyes</span> to my <span title="compagnos de voyage">fellow travelers</span> and <span title="inchoated">began</span> <span title="solivagant">lone-wandering</span> <span title="perambulations">traveling inspection</span>.

        <p>I now realized the fact that I was in a <span title="peregrine">foreign</span> land, <span title="unkent">unknown</span>, a <span title="fren">stranger</span>, <span title="a peripatetic">an itinerant</span> <span title="pedestrious">going on foot</span> <span title="viator">traveler</span>, and apparently <span title="isolated">alone</span>, with the <span title="salvo">exception</span> of a <span title="canine">dog-like</span> <span title="quadruped">four-legged animal</span>, whose <span title="mordacious">biting</span>, <span title="latrant">barking</span>, <span title="lusorious">sportive</span>, and <span title="venatic">hunting</span> qualities are without <span title="parity">equal degree</span>.

        <p><span title="Cicurated">Tamed</span> and <span title="divested">deprived</span> of his <span title="acharnement">savage fierceness</span> and <span title="curstness">peevishness</span>, he has been of great <span title="utility">use</span> to me in his <span title="indagation">searching out</span> of game in their <span title="latitations">lyings in concealment</span>, <span title="latibulums">burrows</span>, or <span title="hibernaculums">winter abiding places</span>; and for his <span title="pervigilations">careful watchings</span>. By his <span title="cerberean">Cerberus-like</span> <span title="latrations">barkings</span>, he has kept in <span title="abeyance">suspension</span> the whole <span title="noctivagant">night-wandering</span> <span title="furacious">thievish</span> race; especially, during the <span title="nocturnal">night-time</span> hours.

        <p>I <span title="onerated">burdened</span> my <span title="dorsal">back</span> part with a <span title="portmanteau">leather bag</span> for the <span title="vectitation">carrying</span> of my <span title="habiliments">garments</span>. My <span title="humeral">upper arm</span>, or <span title="acromial">shoulder blade outer extremity</span> <span title="projecture">jutting beyond the surface</span>, I also <span title="onerated">burdened</span> with an instrument consisting of <span title="ligneous">woody</span> stock and <span title="ferreous">iron</span> tube, for the <span title="enecation">killing off</span> of <span title="aligerous">winged</span> and <span title="volant">flying</span> <span title="bipeds">two-legged creatures</span>, and those animals that are given to <span title="latrociny">theft</span>, or a <span title="predacious">predatory</span> life.

        <p>With this <span title="armature">protective outfit</span> of <span title="accoutrements">accessory clothings</span>, I took up my line of march in a <span title="septentrio-occidental">north-western</span> direction, for distant <span title="oppidan">town</span> and <span title="villatic">village</span> communities. <span title="Amplifying">Increasing</span> <span title="claritude">clearness</span> occupied the <span title="argent">silvery</span> fields above; human, <span title="belluine">beasty</span>, and other entities sustained the radiating <span title="caloric">heat</span> of <span title="Phoebus">the Sun</span>. Exhilirating <span title="euphony">sweet sounds</span> seemed to possess entire <span title="ubiquity">existence in all places</span>. Under this <span title="buoyant">rising</span> physical <span title="revivification">renewal of life</span> I <span title="transcended">passed over</span> <span title="acclivities">uphills</span> and <span title="declivities">downhills</span>, until the <span title="rayonnant">darting forth</span> solar <span title="luminary">heavenly light-giving body</span> had attained <span title="meridonial">noon</span> <span title="arduity">height</span>, pouring down upon me his <span title="calefactory">heating</span> radiations; so that my <span title="corporeal">bodily</span> organization was, in totality, subjected to redundant <span title="sudations">sweatings</span>, necessitating me to bring my <span title="bombycinous">silken</span> <span title="sudary">handkerchief</span> into frequent <span title="requisition">need</span>. After having participated in a <span title="collation">cold luncheon</span>, I submitted my <span title="corporeity">body</span> to <span title="quiescence">rest</span> in a <span title="resupine">lying on the back</span> position; which proved very <span title="acopic">weariness-relieving</span>, and <span title="effectuated">brought about</span> <span title="an instauration">a restoration</span> of my physical energies. Having indulged in something like <span title="pandiculation">drowsy stretching</span>, at least, a sort of involuntary <span title="calisthenical">bodyweight</span> exercise, I resumed the <span title="elongation">lengthening</span> of my <span title="pedaneous">walking</span> <span title="locomotion">travelling</span>, and <span title="protracted">drew out</span> it well past <span title="crepuscule">dusk</span>. Thus ended my <span title="primal">first</span> days <span title="itineration">walking</span>, varied by a <span title="multiplicity">great many</span> of <span title="peregrinities">strange things</span> and <span title="neoteric">new</span> <span title="occurrences">happenings</span>.

        <p>But oh! My <span title="defatigation">weariness</span> and the <span title="turgescence">swelling</span> of my <span title="pedalian">feet</span> extremities! The <span title="cataphracted">callous and hardened</span> <span title="epidermal">skin</span> <span title="integument">covering</span> <span title="abraded">rubbed off</span> from my <span title="malleolar">ankle joint</span> processes and <span title="calcaneal">heel</span> <span title="protrusions">bulges</span>. My <span title="sinistral">left</span> tendo-achilles and the <span title="dorsal">back</span> part of my <span title="dextral">right</span> <span title="hallux">big toe</span> extensively <span title="vesicated">blistered</span> and <span title="excoriated">chafed</span>. But you know, the <span title="initial">beginning</span> part of all enterprises is <span title="arduous">laborious</span>.

        <p><span title="Subsequently to">Following</span> a very <span title="sumptuous">luxurious</span> <span title="vespertine">evening</span> <span title="repast">meal</span>, I <span title="intimated">hinted</span> to the caterer for human and <span title="belluine">beastly</span> <span title="animality">animal existence</span> that, feeling quite <span title="superlatively">greatly</span> <span title="elumbated">weak in the loins</span>, and being somewhat <span title="somniculous">drowsy</span>, I was <span title="propense">disposed</span> to an early <span title="couchee">bedtime reception</span>; and requested that he <span title="indigitate">point out</span> to me a <span title="cubicular">bedroom</span> department, or dormitory, in which I might enjoy <span title="somniferous">sleep-inducing</span> <span title="quietude">quietness</span>. I <span title="elicited">aroused</span> from my host an <span title="obstriction">obligation</span> to cause my <span title="experrection">waking up</span> when the <span title="caligation">dimness</span> of the night was yielding to the <span title="clarity">clearness</span> of the <span title="remeant">returning</span> <span title="exortive">east-rising</span> solar sphere. <span title="Prior to">Before</span> <span title="decumbency">lying down</span> on my couch, I submitted my <span title="pedal">feet</span> and <span title="crural">leg</span> organs to a <span title="defecation">purification</span> by a <span title="copious">plentiful</span> <span title="lavation">cleansing</span> with <span title="medicated">medicinally furnished</span> <span title="saponaceous">soapy</span> <span title="abstergents">detergents</span>.

        <p>This <span title="pediluvy">feet bathing</span> and <span title="ablution">ritual washing</span>, though I yet suffered a slight <span title="vellication">twitching</span> in my <span title="femoral">thigh</span> organs, gave me a <span title="proclivity">proneness</span> for an indulgence of my <span title="somnolency">sleepiness</span> without <span title="intercission">intervention</span>. In the <span title="matin">early morning</span>, according to <span title="paction">contract</span>, the <span title="aubergist">inn-keeper</span> <span title="exsuscitated">excited</span> me at the first <span title="canorous">melodious</span> <span title="peal">bell-like sounds</span> of the <span title="chanticleer">young rooster</span>. After the customary <span title="matutinal">morning</span> <span title="manal">hand</span> and <span title="facial">face</span> <span title="ablution">cleansing</span> and <span title="abstersion">wiping clean</span>, and <span title="capital">head</span> <span title="pectination">combing</span>, and a very satisfactory <span title="impletion">filling up</span> of my <span title="epigastric">stomach</span> <span title="receptacle">repository</span>. I asked for the <span title="supputation">reckoning</span> with him; and having duly adjusted the same, I resumed <span title="ambulatory">walking</span> <span title="incession">motion on foot</span>. The <span title="ceruleous">sky-blue</span> canopy was merging into <span title="fulgidity">splendor</span> from the ascending <span title="rayonnant">darting forth</span> <span title="Phoebus">Sun</span>. Every <span title="entity">being</span> about me seemed to <span title="revel">take delight</span> in universal <span title="resuscitation">reviving</span>. I performed my <span title="quotidian">daily</span> <span title="locomotion">moving from place to place</span> for several <span title="diurnal revolutions">days</span>; witnessing a <span title="multiplicity">multitude</span> of occurrences <span title="homologous">similar</span> to those already specified.

        <p>One day, when the <span title="solar sphere">Sun</span> had <span title="culminated">reached a peak</span>, I, being much <span title="exantlated">exhausted</span> from continuous <span title="deambulation">walkings abroad</span>, gave way to a <span title="recubation">leaning upon</span> under an isolated, <span title="multiramose">many-branched</span>, <span title="umbrageous">shady</span> tree, <span title="attiguous to">bordering</span> the trail, for the purpose of exercising my <span title="masticators">chewing organs</span> upon the contents of my <span title="viaticum">journey provisions</span>. Having furnished <span title="refocillation">strength restoration by refreshment</span> to my system, <span title="recumbent">lying back</span> on my <span title="dorsal">back</span> part, I viewed the <span title="plumous">feathery</span> <span title="tenants">dwellers</span> of the air in their <span title="evolutions">flying around</span> among the <span title="ramifications">branches</span> of the tree, and the <span title="illusive">deceptive</span> mirage in the distance. Having <span title="discalceated">removed shoes</span>, I <span title="perfricated">rubbed over</span> my <span title="recrudescent">sore-becoming</span> and <span title="attrited">worn by friction</span> <span title="pedal">feet</span> organs with an <span title="iatroleptical">anointing</span> <span title="cerate">waxy and oily ointment</span>, and then, becoming <span title="profligated">overcome</span> with <span title="somnolency">sleepiness</span>, I <span title="relapsed">fell back</span> into a <span title="post prandial">post-dinner</span> <span title="siesta">early afternoon nap</span>. Schnell, for that was the <span title="cognomination">surname</span> of my <span title="canine">dog</span> <span title="companion">friend</span> and <span title="presidiary">guard</span>, - <span title="advigilated">carefully watched</span>. I was, however soon <span title="suscitated">excited</span> by an electrical detonation from the <span title="septentrional">northern</span> part of the horizon. So soon as my <span title="ophthalmic organs">eyes</span> had undergone <span title="patefaction">opening</span>, I realized that <span title="nubiferous">cloud-bearing</span> gales were in operation, <span title="agglomerating">rolling up</span> a most <span title="ominous">threatening</span> and <span title="impendent">imminent</span> <span title="cumu-cirro-stratus">rain storm</span> <span title="thunderhead">cloud</span>. The <span title="welkin">visible sky</span> was rapidly <span title="obnubilating">becoming clouded</span>, and <span title="tenebrosity">darkness</span> <span title="amplifying">increasing</span>. The <span title="crispations">curlings</span> and <span title="furcations">forkings</span> of the <span title="fulgurations">lightning strikes</span> became <span title="vivid">bright and strong</span>, and the <span title="fulminations">thunder claps</span> <span title="horrisonous">dreadful sounding</span>. In a <span title="brevity">shortness</span> of time there was a <span title="copious">plentiful</span> <span title="precipitation">downpour</span> of <span title="pluvious">rain</span> <span title="globules">drops</span>, which subjected me and Schnell to thorough <span title="madefaction">soaking</span>.

        <p>The <span title="arroyos">water courses</span> assumed such <span title="ampliations">enlargements</span> as might be <span title="instyled">called</span> a local <span title="torrential">outpouring</span> <span title="cataclysm">earthly catastrophe</span>. <span title="Aqueous">Watery</span> domination prevailed on earth; <span title="igneous">fiery</span> <span title="potency">power</span> and <span title="fulmineous">thundery</span> <span title="reverberations">echoes</span> <span title="predominated">overpowered</span> in the <span title="nubiferous">cloud-bearing</span> regions; and <span title="a resistless">an overpowering</span> <span title="ventosity">windiness</span> maintained <span title="horrendous">frightful</span> <span title="boation">roaring</span> in the atmosphere. The <span title="fulgurations">lightnings</span> communicated their <span title="igneous">fiery</span> <span title="potency">power</span> to a <span title="rancho">cabin</span> <span title="sans">without</span> <span title="paratonnerres">lightning rods</span>, setting in it <span title="flagration">intense fire</span>; <span title="terminating">ending</span> in entire <span title="incineration">burning to ashes</span>. Being <span title="untenanted">uninhabited</span>, no one fell a prey to cremation. I and Schnell had to engage in the <span title="transilience">leaping across</span> and <span title="tranation">swimming across</span> of several <span title="arroyos">water courses</span>; which greatly <span title="augmented">added to</span> the <span title="ponderosity">heaviness</span> of our <span title="envelopes">coverings</span>. Ultimately, as the day began to <span title="advesperate">turn to evening</span>, but <span title="prior to">before</span> the <span title="cadence">going down</span> of <span title="Phoebus">the Sun</span>, - with <span title="pedal">foot</span> <span title="envelopes">coverings</span> and the <span title="inferior">lower</span> portion of my <span title="femoral">thigh</span> <span title="habiliments">clothes</span> subjected to quite <span title="an illutation">a mud bath</span>, I arrived at <span title="an adobe">a mud brick</span> <span title="chalet">herdsman's hut</span>.

        <p><span title="Anthracitic">Anthracite-like</span> and <span title="ligneous">wooden</span> <span title="combustibles">burnable things</span> were deposited in a <span title="spacious">roomy</span> <span title="calefactor">heater</span>, and <span title="accended">set on fire</span> with <span title="an allumette">a lighting match</span>, giving me an opportunity for <span title="torrefaction">roasting dry</span>, or <span title="divaporation">driving out of vapours</span>. I was soon summoned to the <span title="refectory">refreshment room</span> by <span title="tintinnabular">bell</span> <span title="reverberations">echoes</span>, where I found <span title="ample">plentiful</span> <span title="cenatory">supper</span> refreshments.

        <p><span title="Tenebrosity">Darkness</span> having by this time encircled our <span title="moiety">half</span> of <span title="this mundane sphere">Earth</span>, I soon sank into the <span title="gremium">embrace</span> of <span title="Morpheus">the Roman god of sleep and dreams</span>.

        <p>The day <span title="subsequent to">following</span> the <span title="procellous">stormy</span> <span title="vesper">evening</span> on which I <span title="effectuated">brought about</span> the <span title="arefaction, or calefaction">heating</span> of my <span title="habiliments">items of clothing</span> was not very <span title="inservient">conducive</span> to the progress of a <span title="pedestrious">foot-going</span> <span title="viator">traveler</span>. It is true, the atmospheric regions, at first <span title="subnuvolar">somewhat cloudy</span>, soon became <span title="enubilated">cleared from clouds</span>; and <span title="old Sol">the Sun</span> did not radiate his <span title="sudorific">sweat-causing</span> <span title="caloric">heat</span> so <span title="potently">powerfully</span> as on <span title="the hesternal day">yesterday</span>, but the roads had, in some places, become <span title="lutulent">muddy</span> and somewhat <span title="clarty">sticky and foul</span>; presenting great <span title="difficiliation">difficulty</span> to my incessant velocity, on account of the <span title="viscosity">stickiness</span> of the surface.

        <p><span title="In consequent">Following</span> my frequent <span title="stoppages">stops</span>, on account of the <span title="lutarious">muddy</span> and <span title="salebrous">rough</span> condition of the trail, I had <span title="ample">plentiful</span> opportunity to exercise my <span title="optics">eyes</span> upon the aspects of the <span title="circumjacent">bordering</span> regions. The <span title="sinuosities">bends and turns</span> of the <span title="vales">valleys</span>; the <span title="rupellary">rocky</span> <span title="canons">deep water worn gorges</span>; the <span title="titanic">large</span>, <span title="scabrous">rough</span>, <span title="nival">snow</span> crested <span title="Aeonian">everlasting</span> mountain peaks; the <span title="feracity">fruitfulness</span> of the <span title="terreous">earthy</span> surface <span title="pertingent to">reaching to</span> the <span title="aqueous">watery</span> <span title="meanders">stream curves</span>, excited in me the greatest <span title="oblectation">pleasing</span>. I arrived one day at a place somewhat <span title="multivious">having many roads</span>; and there being no <span title="milliaries">milestone</span> or <span title="odometrous">road distance measuring</span> stones, I soon became disoriented. In the course of my <span title="deambulations">walkings abroad</span>, my vision was <span title="regaled">treated</span> with <span title="an occiduous">a western</span>, <span title="floriferous">flower-bearing</span> savanna; having in its <span title="septentrional">northern</span>, <span title="oriental">eastern</span>, and <span title="austral">southern</span> sections, a slight <span title="subsidence">sinking in the ground</span>. Its <span title="terreous">earthy</span> surface was a perfect <span title="chessom">mellow earth</span>, wholly <span title="nonscatebrous">not rough</span>. In my <span title="transcursion">passing across</span> to a designated point, my attention was <span title="arrested">seized</span> by the <span title="audition">hearing</span> of a very <span title="puissant">strong</span> <span title="sibilation">hissing</span> in great <span title="proximity">nearness</span> to Schnell. He gave a <span title="subitaneous">sudden</span> <span title="resilience">leaping back</span>. By <span title="chary">cautious</span> <span title="perscrutation">searching</span>, I perceived a <span title="fissilingual">fork-tongued</span>, <span title="batrachophagous">frog-eating</span>, <span title="anguine">snake-like</span> <span title="creeple">creeping reptile</span>, a <span title="crotalus">large rattle snake</span>, circularly <span title="recumbent">lying</span>. His <span title="cutaneous">skin</span> <span title="envelope">covering</span> was <span title="squamous">scaly</span>, <span title="cupreous">coppery</span>, and <span title="fulgid">shiny</span>. His <span title="caudal extremity">tail</span> was <span title="cuspidated">pointed</span> with a <span title="corneous">horny</span> <span title="apex">peak</span>. Schnell made a <span title="temerarious">reckless</span> <span title="supersalient">leaping upon</span> <span title="assault">attack</span> upon him, but received such a <span title="siserary">hard blow</span> upon his <span title="rhinal protrusion">nose</span> as immediately induced incessant <span title="jactitation">tossing of the body</span>. <span title="Tumefaction">Swelling</span> with <span title="ineffable">indescribable</span> <span title="celerity">quickness</span> became visible in his <span title="physical organization">body</span>. Being somewhat <span title="scient">versed</span> in <span title="toxicology">the science of poison treatments</span> and <span title="pantagruelism">the theory of the medical profession</span>, I administered to him, in the utmost <span title="brevity">shortness</span> of time, <span title="alexiterics">poison remedies</span>, <span title="antiphlogistics">inflammation remedies</span>, and other pharmacy. This treatment produced immediate <span title="detumescence">reduction of swelling</span> and <span title="revalescence">recovery</span>. Though this assault upon him did not prove <span title="exitial">fatal</span>, yet, in his <span title="resilience">springing back</span> from the <span title="dipsas">fabled serpent</span> he suffered the <span title="exarticulation">joint dislocation</span>, or rather, the <span title="subluxation">partial dislocation</span> of his <span title="sinistral">left</span> <span title="crural organ">leg</span>; which, in his <span title="subsequent">following</span> <span title="circumcursations">runnings about</span>, <span title="extorted">forced</span> the most <span title="streperous">noisy</span> <span title="ejaculations">outcries</span>. He soon however, enjoyed complete <span title="sanation">soundness</span>, and was freed from every traumatic <span title="vestige">trace</span>, and relieved of all <span title="osteocope">violent fixed bone pain</span> by a <span title="nepenthe and antalgics">pain relieving medicine</span>. His <span title="subastral">beneath the stars</span> <span title="vitality">life</span> has, however, since <span title="terminated">ended</span>. Fritz, a <span title="castrensian">camp</span> <span title="acolythist">assistant</span> of mine, <span title="an ardent">a passionate</span> lover of <span title="cynegetics">hunting with dogs</span> and <span title="aucupation">birdcatching</span>, made a <span title="pteriplegistic">bird-shooting</span> <span title="venatorial">hunting</span> tour, and induced Schnell to accompany him. On the succeeding <span title="matin">morning</span>, as they were <span title="appropinquating">drawing near</span> a <span title="lapideous">stony</span> and <span title="scopulous">rocky</span> elevation, Schnell, in his <span title="circumcursations">running abouts</span>, - <span title="ventre a terre">at full speed</span>, - was <span title="allected">allured</span> by the <span title="fumette">meat odor</span> of a <span title="cache">place for hiding provisions</span>. He there <span title="habnab">by chance</span>, met a <span title="hirsute">shaggy</span>, <span title="hippophagous">horse-eating</span>, <span title="sarcophagous">flesh-eating</span>, <span title="ichthyophagous">fish-eating</span>, <span title="melliphagous">honey-eating</span>, <span title="insectivorous">insect-eating</span>, <span title="vermivorous">worm-eating</span>, <span title="frugivorous">fruit-eating</span>, and <span title="anthropophagous">man-eating</span> <span title="ursine">bear-like</span> <span title="quadruped">four-legged animal</span>. A terrific <span title="sanguinary">bloody</span> <span title="cynarctomachy">dog and bear fight</span> <span title="ensued">followed</span>. In the <span title="circumgyrations">rolling arounds</span> of the <span title="battailants">fighters</span>, Schnell rendered <span title="Bruin">bear</span> <span title="excaudate">tailless</span>; but <span title="Bruin">bear</span> being <span title="unguiculated">clawed</span>, seized Schnell with one paw by the <span title="neb">nose</span> and <span title="submaxillary">under jaw</span> appendage in the <span title="hyomental">front of neck</span> region, and with the other, grasped his <span title="capillose">hairy</span> <span title="dermal">skin</span> <span title="integument">protective covering</span> in the lateral part, and almost <span title="exenterated">emboweled</span> him, and quite <span title="suggilated">viciously beat</span> him. By an extra <span title="conatus">effort</span>, Schnell effected his <span title="eluctation">struggling</span> from <span title="Bruin">bear</span>; but through <span title="hors de combat">out of the fight</span>, his <span title="claudication">limping</span> from the arena of <span title="concertation">strife</span>, or <span title="obluctation">resistance</span>, prompted the most <span title="puissant">powerful</span> <span title="ululations">dog howls</span>. The <span title="lancinations">torn up conditions</span>, <span title="mauger">despite</span> all <span title="epulotic">skin healing</span>, <span title="catagmatic">bone healing</span> and <span title="cicatrisive">scar healing</span> appliances, and all available <span title="aciurgical and chirurgical">surgical</span> skill, - <span title="sphacelated">became gangrenous</span>. <span title="Interosseal">Between bones</span> and <span title="cervical">neck</span> <span title="inturgescence">swelling</span> induced <span title="angina">quinsy</span>; terminating in <span title="lethality">death</span>. He was <span title="contumulated">buried</span> <span title="farantly">respectably</span>.

        <p>After <span title="hospitating">receiving hospitality</span> for a <span title="noctidial">night and day</span> period with a <span title="vaquero">cowboy</span>, I entered into a <span title="pactitious">settled by agreement</span> contract with him. During my <span title="tyrociny">apprenticeship</span> as <span title="vaquero">cowboy</span>, though not a <span title="novice">beginner</span> in <span title="equitancy">horsemanship</span>, and riding <span title="tantivy">galloping violently</span>, yet, in segregating and <span title="corraling">penning</span> <span title="macrocornous">long-horned</span> <span title="bovines">cows</span> for <span title="inustion">branding</span>; in <span title="omnium-gatherum">hodgepodge</span> aggregations, or rodeos, and in <span title="abgregating">leading out</span> <span title="mavericks">strays</span>, - my <span title="equestrian">horse riding</span> acrobatic feats, - vaulting from the <span title="dorsal">back</span> part of bucking bronchos, - was, for a time, truly, <span title="mirabile visu">wonderful to behold</span>.

        <p>Eventually, in view of the <span title="avolation">flying away</span>, or <span title="evanescence">fading away</span> of the <span title="aestival">summer</span> and <span title="autumnal">autumn</span> seasons, and the approximation of <span title="brumal">winter</span> <span title="gelidity">coldness</span>, and <span title="cadent">falling</span> <span title="niveous">snowy</span> particles, and moreover, being <span title="ruricolist">from the country</span> rather than <span title="an oppidan">a townsman</span>, I entered in <span title="a paction">an agreement</span> with <span title="an occiduous">a western</span> <span title="proprietor">businessman</span> of a section of <span title="terra firma">land</span>.

        <p>In conclusion, I will say, - I have today felt somewhat <span title="writative">inclined to write</span>, and hence, my present <span title="epistolizing">letter-writing</span> is <span title="voluminous">large in volume</span> as Thucydides, and strung out like the <span title="caudal appendage">tail</span> of Alcibiades' <span title="canine">dog</span>. I have <span title="opisthographized">writing on the back</span> much; <span title="postillated">annotated</span> <span title="emendatory">corrective</span> criticisms here and there, and added so much <span title="paraphrastical">rewording to clarify</span> <span title="marginalia">margin notes</span>, that <span title="verily">truly</span> - <span title="redolet lucernae">it smells of lamp</span>.

        <p>With <span title="accustomary">usual</span> <span title="comity">good will</span>

        <p>Most <span title="Philomathic">Learning Loving</span> and <span title="Calligraphical">Fine Penmanship</span> Sir:

        <p>In the <span title="finale">close</span> of my last <span title="lucubratory">composed by candlelight</span> <span title="epistolary">letter-like</span> <span title="palimpsest">manuscript erased clean for reuse</span>, I gave you <span title="cognizance">awareness</span> of the <span title="verity">truth</span>, that at the <span title="inchoation">beginning</span> of the <span title="pruinous">frosty</span> season, I entered into <span title="a paction">an agreement</span> with a certain <span title="ponent">western</span> <span title="agricultor">farmer</span>. I am not <span title="au fait">skillful</span> in <span title="orthology">the right description of things</span>, but I will <span title="essay">try</span> to <span title="impart">give</span> to you <span title="cognition">knowledge</span> of my position during my <span title="commoration">residing</span> with the said <span title="excerebrous">brainless</span> <span title="mephistophelian">devilish</span> <span title="agricolist">farmer</span>. Such <span title="scleragogy">severe discipline</span>! Such a <span title="protraction">lengthening</span> of <span title="vitality">life</span>! The <span title="parvitude">littleness</span> of his <span title="augean">extremely dirty</span>, <span title="pulicous">flea-bitten</span> <span title="habitance">abode</span>! The <span title="fuliginous">sooty</span> <span title="calefactor">stove</span> with carbon fuel; the <span title="rimosity">chinkiness</span>, or <span title="fatiscence">opening</span> of its walls; the <span title="tenuity">thinness</span> of the <span title="thoral">bed</span> <span title="greith">furniture</span>, or <span title="integuments">protective covering</span>, - <span title="replete">full</span> with <span title="sanguinivorous">blood-eating</span> <span title="cimisses">bedbugs</span>, - are indeed <span title="asthenic">weak</span> <span title="defensatives">protectives</span> against the <span title="algidity">coldness</span> induced by the <span title="frigorific">chilling</span> <span title="perflations">blow throughs</span> of the <span title="Aquilon">north wind</span> and <span title="Caecias">south-eastern wind</span>.

        <p>Our <span title="edibles">food</span>, or <span title="cagmag">bad food</span>, consisted of <span title="furfuraceous">bran</span> cakes, <span title="azymous">unleavened</span> <span title="jannocks">oat-breads</span>, <span title="fusty">musty</span> <span title="chitterlings">sausages</span>, <span title="charqui">jerked beef</span>, <span title="lobscouse">vegetable hash</span>, and a <span title="tenuous">thin</span> <span title="insapory">tasteless</span> <span title="puree">soup</span>.

        <p>The <span title="idiopathic">arising from unknown causes</span> <span title="microcephalous">small-headed</span> <span title="paterfamilias">head of the family</span> and <span title="dominus">owner</span> of the <span title="domicile">house</span>, is <span title="fastuous">arrogant</span>, <span title="brigose">contentious</span>, and possessed of a most <span title="apodeictical">unquestionably demonstrated</span> <span title="philauty">self-love</span>. He is a <span title="genio">peculiar man</span> - a <span title="curioso">virtuoso</span>. A conformity to his <span title="punctilious">meticulous</span> <span title="precisianism">devotion to rules</span>, is, <span title="veritably">truly</span>, a <span title="quodlibet">debatable point</span>. He coerced me to <span title="moider">toil</span> during the <span title="diurnal">daytime</span> period, like a <span title="moke">donkey</span>, and harassed me with <span title="antelucan">before day</span> <span title="blatterations">senseless babbling</span>. He is <span title="multinomious, or polyonomous">much named</span>, as I have <span title="multititulated">given many titles to</span> him, <span title="Megalophon">loud mouthed</span> <span title="Fustilugs">fatty</span> <span title="Dizzard">blockhead</span> <span title="Culion">coward</span> <span title="Rodomont">braggart</span> <span title="Pyrrhonist">disbeliever</span>. His <span title="tetricity">perverseness</span>, <span title="carency">deficiency</span> of <span title="bonity">goodness</span>, <span title="xenodochy">hospitality</span>, <span title="aphilanthropy">hatred of others</span>, <span title="parvanimity">little mindedness</span>, and abnormal <span title="anthropophuism">ascription of human nature to God</span>, are <span title="antipathetical">unnatural</span> to his <span title="vicinal">local</span> <span title="cotemporaries">contemporaries</span> and the <span title="metics">sojourners</span> in his <span title="convicinity">neighborhood</span>.

        <p>As to his <span title="proletaneous">numerous-offspring-having</span>, <span title="abdominous">large bellied</span>, <span title="flavicomous">golden haired</span>, <span title="hypognathous">projecting-lower-jawed</span>, <span title="foveated">pitted</span> <span title="fraken">freckle</span> <span title="visaged">faced</span> <span title="cepevorous">onion-eating</span>, <span title="vociferous">noisy</span> consort, I have <span title="appellated and yclept">named</span> her, - <span title="Oleosity">Fatness</span> <span title="Impudicity">Immodesty</span> Amazon <span title="Rixatrix">Scolding Woman</span> <span title="Immundicity">Uncleanness</span>. The passing of the <span title="macilent">thin</span> <span title="Chichevache">Enormous cow</span> never <span title="agrises">shudders at</span> or causes her the least <span title="horripilation">bristling of the hairs</span>.

        <p>Having become <span title="an acephalist">one who acknowledges no superior</span>, and <span title="fatigated">tired</span> with <span title="assiduate">unremitting</span> <span title="supererogatory">more than needed</span> <span title="vernile">servile</span> toil, I <span title="protracted">shortened</span> my <span title="obdormition">sleep</span> according to <span title="autocephalous">independent of external authority</span> <span title="arbitrament">authoritative judgment</span>, <span title="mauger">despite</span> all his <span title="stentorophonic">loud sounding</span> <span title="blatterations">senseless babblings</span> and <span title="perstreperousness">noisiness</span> to <span title="exsuscitate">arouse</span> me. This occasioned a <span title="rixation">brawl</span> which eventuated in my <span title="prolating">stretching out</span> a very <span title="dyslogistic">disapproval expressing</span> <span title="sempiternal">everlasting</span> <span title="valediction">farewell</span> to his <span title="maledicted">cursed</span> bye. This was in <span title="consension">agreement</span> with <span title="affectuosity">earnestness</span>; for I would rather be a <span title="mundivagant">world-wandering</span> than a <span title="latreutical">serving</span> mercenary, and fraternize with and be <span title="ditionary">under rule</span>, or <span title="subjicible">capable of being subjected</span> to such <span title="an excerebrous">a brainless</span>, abysmally <span title="nescient">ignorant</span> a <span title="sept">tribe</span> as his.

        <p>I resumed <span title="circumforaneous">wandering</span> <span title="bibliopolistical">book selling</span> functions, and after the <span title="profection">progression</span> of about a <span title="triduan">three day</span> period subsequent to <span title="prolating">uttering</span> my <span title="eviternal">everlasting</span> adieu to the <span title="execrable">poor quality</span> <span title="terraculturist">agriculture</span> and <span title="rancho">hut</span> with a drastic <span title="Parthian">delivered in retreat</span> shot, I approximated an <span title="urbiculous">urban</span> community; in the <span title="suburbicarian">suburb</span> precincts, or <span title="purlieus">outskirts</span> of which I beheld <span title="an omnium-gatherum">a miscellaneous collection</span> <span title="rabblement">crowd of common people</span>, consisting of <span title="queans">wenches</span>, <span title="giglets">laughing girls</span>, <span title="malkins">drabs</span>, <span title="cinderwenches">drudges</span>, <span title="galliards">merry people</span>, <span title="mumpers">beggars</span>, <span title="skipjacks">upstarts</span>, <span title="beldames">old women</span>, <span title="belamours">lovers</span>, <span title="cuttles">foul-mouthed fellows</span>, <span title="michers">thieves</span>, <span title="clumps">stupid fellows</span>, <span title="doodles">triflers</span>, nincompoops, cosmopolitans, <span title="curmudgeons">misers</span>, <span title="ninnyhammers">half wits</span>, <span title="tatterdemalions">ragtags</span>, <span title="hobbledehoys">awkward adolescent boys</span>, and <span title="slubberdegullions">filthy, slobbering people</span>. All these gave attention to the <span title="prestigiations">slight of hand tricks</span> of a <span title="thaumaturgical">magical and miraculous</span> <span title="engastrimuth">ventriloquist</span> and <span title="geomancer">fortune-teller interpreting ground markings</span>. He made the <span title="asseveratory">positively asserting</span> declaration that he could give <span title="ocular">visual</span> <span title="apodixis">full demonstration</span> that he possessed complete cognition of <span title="metoposcopy">fortune telling using the markings of the forehead</span>, <span title="ophthalmoscopy">interior eye inspection</span>, <span title="chiromancy">fortune telling using markings on the hand</span>, <span title="rhabdomancy">searching for underground water using a dowsing rod</span>, <span title="astragalomancy">fortune telling using small bones or dice</span>, <span title="arithmancy">fortune telling using numbers</span>, <span title="capnomancy">fortune telling using smoke rising from a fire</span>, and <span title="onomancy">fortune telling using letters of a name</span>. He <span title="averred">asserted</span> that he was <span title="an adept">a skilled</span> <span title="oneirocritic">interpreter of dreams</span>, <span title="cultrivorist">knife swallower</span>, and <span title="funambulist">rope walker</span>.

        <p>The <span title="ariolation">fortune telling</span> and <span title="recluding">unfolding</span> of the future terrestrial allotments of the <span title="congeries">crowds</span> that <span title="environed">surrounded</span> this <span title="pseudo-omniscious">falsely-all-knowing</span> <span title="mirabilary">narrator of wonderful things</span>, <span title="effectuated">caused</span> singular phases in their <span title="phizes">faces</span>. Those who, by a <span title="spectation">looking</span> either into <span title="aqueous">watery</span> liquids, or upon the <span title="nodosities">knots</span> of a <span title="caduceus">rod</span> or upon the <span title="corrugations">wrinkles</span> of their <span title="mannal">hand</span> extremities, or by any other media of <span title="auguration">foretelling</span> or <span title="vaticination">prophecy</span>, were favored with a perception of their future <span title="beatitude">happiness</span>, became <span title="salient">leaping</span> with <span title="delectation">delight</span>, and emitted the most <span title="obstreperous">noisy</span> <span title="cachinnations">hysterical laughter</span>; whilst others, beholding either their proximity to the <span title="irremeable">admitting no return</span> <span title="bourne">boundary</span>, or much <span title="amaritude">bitterness</span> <span title="immixed">mixed</span> with the evolutions of the filaments of their <span title="sublunary">earthly</span> <span title="vitality">life</span>, became quite <span title="cogitabund">deeply thoughtful</span>, <span title="atrabilarian">melancholic</span>, <span title="querimonious">complaining</span>, pessimistic, and <span title="exacerbated">worsened</span>.

        <p>Leaving the <span title="fatiloquent">prophetic</span> <span title="flabbergaster">surpriser</span> and his <span title="dupes">tricked victims</span>, and <span title="desiderating">desiring</span> the deletion of <span title="nescience">ignorance</span>, as also the <span title="impletion">filling</span> of my <span title="nummular">money</span> <span title="crumenal">purse</span> with <span title="rhino">money</span>, whilst <span title="hiemating">passing the winter</span>, - for, as you know, <span title="absque argento omnia vano">without money all is vain</span> - I decided to demonstrate my <span title="didacticity">aptitude for teaching</span> by becoming a <span title="propaedeutical">preparative</span> <span title="domine">schoolmaster</span>; and hence, I entered into a <span title="synallagmatic">reciprocal</span> <span title="astipulation">contract</span> as <span title="rural">countryside</span> <span title="pedagogue">teacher</span>. So soon as the <span title="requisite">necessary</span> <span title="subsignations">signatures</span> could be secured to the <span title="bipartite">double</span> <span title="stipendiary">wage-receiving</span> <span title="syngraph">writing signed by both parties to a contract</span>, I entered the <span title="phrontistery">schoolhouse</span>, and assumed <span title="paideutical">teaching</span> and <span title="chrestomathic">useful teaching</span> functions.

        <p>About the time of my becoming an <span title="erudiating">instructing</span> <span title="literator">educator</span> of frontier <span title="bairns">children</span>, I resorted to <span title="an umbratical">a shady</span> <span title="castrametation">camping</span> containing <span title="multitudinous">many</span> <span title="audients">listeners</span>; addressed by a <span title="homilist">preacher</span>. The <span title="sere">dry</span> autumnal season; the dense <span title="tenebrious">gloomy</span> <span title="umbrosity">shade</span> of the <span title="bushet">small brush</span>; and the <span title="moliminous">important</span> occasion of the <span title="comportation">bringing together</span>, were <span title="conducent">tending</span> to the <span title="exsuscitation">rousing</span> of <span title="pietism">strict devotion</span>, or <span title="epicedian">funereal</span> emotions. The <span title="abearance">deportment</span>, <span title="ostent">appearance</span>, and <span title="physiognomical">facial</span> aspects of the <span title="ecclesiasts">preachers</span> present, furnished a <span title="roboration">strengthening</span> of the already generated <span title="saturnity">solemnity</span>.

        <p>The <span title="anteriority">former part</span> of the officiating <span title="homilist's">preacher's</span> existence had been rather <span title="sinuous">winding</span> and <span title="protean">changeful</span>. His <span title="juvenility">youthfulness</span> had been <span title="maculated">stained</span> with many vicious, <span title="triobolary">worthless</span> <span title="extravagations">excesses</span> and <span title="nefandous">wicked</span> abominations. At the termination of his adolescence, he became a <span title="fustilarian">scoundrel</span>, a <span title="scambler">sponge</span>, a <span title="literator">teacher</span>, <span title="an arpentator">a surveyor</span>, <span title="an acutiator">a razor grinder</span>, a <span title="horologist">watch repairer</span>, and <span title="an omnivagant">a wanderer of everywhere</span> under the profession of <span title="chiropodist">specialist in foot care</span>, <span title="bletonist">underground water detector</span>, and <span title="vulcanian">metalworking</span> journeyman. By an <span title="esoteric">obscure</span> and imaginary <span title="supernal">heavenly</span> influence, he was speedily transformed into an <span title="entheastic">inspired</span> <span title="pietist">sentimental religionist</span>; and he transferred the <span title="acumen">keen insight</span> of his mental vision from secular and <span title="terrene">earthly</span> objects, into cryptic and <span title="acroamatical">deep learned</span> parts of the <span title="hagiography">saintly writings</span>. <span title="Surcharged">Filled</span> with <span title="bibliomania">obsession for books</span>, he was <span title="propense">inclined</span> to <span title="bibliomancy">fortune telling by books</span>. He was a thorough <span title="solifidian">faith believing</span> <span title="catabaptist">opposer of baptism</span> and <span title="saturnist">grave and gloomy person</span>; and I may <span title="adject">add</span>, a mere <span title="theologaster">pretender in theology</span>, - an <span title="empirical">experimenting</span> <span title="idiopathic">peculiar</span> <span title="suist">selfish person</span>. His <span title="hierology">sacred treatise</span> was on the <span title="appropinquation">approach</span> of the <span title="chiliastic">millenarian</span> <span title="empyrosis">conflagration</span> of this <span title="mundane oblate spheroid">earth</span>, or <span title="macrocosm">great world</span>, based on the <span title="fatidical">prophetic</span> parts of the <span title="hierography">sacred writings</span>.

        <p>His <span title="farrand">manner</span> of <span title="allocution">address</span> was <span title="sui generis">unique</span>.

        <p>Not withstanding his boasted <span title="opsimathy">education late in life</span>, the illiteracy and <span title="inurbanity">rudeness</span> of the <span title="precedaneous">previous</span> part of his life was very <span title="tralucent">translucent</span>. His intonations were <span title="dolorous">sorrowful</span>, and in the mobility of his <span title="corporeity">body</span> he resembled a <span title="funambulist">rope walker</span>. In his <span title="elocution">style of speaking</span>, his vocal powers ascended from an almost inaudible <span title="susurration">whisper</span> to <span title="crocitation">croaking</span>, and from <span title="crocitation">croaking</span> to <span title="cacophonic">bad sounding</span> <span title="vociferation">crying out</span> as made him <span title="dreul">drool</span>, and was <span title="puissant">powerful</span> enough to <span title="laniate">tear into pieces</span> his <span title="guttural orifice">throat</span>. His <span title="cadences">voice lowering</span> terminated in mere <span title="raucous">harsh</span> <span title="susurrations">whispers</span>. His <span title="defectuous">faulty</span> <span title="mimesis">imitation</span> of Whitefield was quite perceptible. In his <span title="eclaircissement">explanation</span> of the <span title="vaticinal">prophetic</span> portion of the <span title="hagiography">saintly writings</span> in relation, <span title="eschatologically">regarding the end of the world</span>, - to the <span title="chiliastic">millennial</span> finale of this <span title="mundane">earthly</span> structure, he made certain occurrences chronologically synchronous, or <span title="equitemporaneous">at the same time</span>, which <span title="glossologists">interpreters</span> and authentic <span title="historiographers">authorities on history</span> greatly <span title="eloigned">taken away</span> from each other. In his <span title="epilogisms">computations</span> in relation to <span title="fatidical">prophetic</span> events, he <span title="evinced">showed</span> <span title="an aspernation">a contempt</span> of all <span title="embolisms">insertions into a calendar</span>.

        <p>He gave <span title="an anagogical">a mystically interpretative</span>, <span title="chimerical">imaginary</span>, and <span title="acataleptic">incomprehensible</span> interpretation to prophetical icons, which all <span title="noetic">mental</span> <span title="elucidators">explainers</span> have <span title="perpended">pondered</span> as literal. In <span title="verity">truth</span>, his <span title="cacodoxical">heretical</span> <span title="hierology">sacred treatise</span> was so <span title="replete">full</span> with <span title="anfractuosities">windings and turnings</span>, <span title="pseudological">fantastically falsified</span> <span title="fallencies">mistakes</span>, <span title="prochronisms">datings of events before they happened</span>, <span title="isochronisms">equalities in duration</span>, <span title="parachronisms">datings of events after they happened</span>, and <span title="illogicalities">incorrect reasonings</span>, that the entirety of the matter became <span title="dubitable">doubted</span>, <span title="ancipitable">having two meanings</span>, and quite <span title="amphigorical">nonsensical</span> to me, notwithstanding the fact his sapient <span title="connictations">winkings</span> in the formation of his <span title="ergoisms">pedantic adherences to rules</span>, seemed to exhibit his <span title="plerophory">full persuasion of confidence</span> of assurance that the proximity of the <span title="empyrosis">conflagration</span> was no longer a <span title="dubiosity">state of being doubtful</span>, or <span title="syncretistical">thought unifying</span> <span title="quodlibet">irreconcilable problem</span>. His <span title="parenetical">encouraging</span> <span title="epilogation">summing up</span>, seized the <span title="cullibility">credulity</span> of his <span title="atechnic">uneducated</span> <span title="audients">listeners</span>, and greatly <span title="exagitated">aroused</span>.

        <p>The <span title="plateau">high level ground</span> of <span title="castrametation">encampment</span> was <span title="quinquepartite">fivefold</span>. The one <span title="anent">regarding</span>, or <span title="paravant">in front of</span> the <span title="ambo, or rostrum">pulpit</span>, having a <span title="sepiment">partition</span> for <span title="demarcation">separation</span>, had a <span title="stramineous">straw-like</span> or <span title="festucous">chaff-like</span> surface for the occupancy of the <span title="sequents">follower</span> and <span title="questants">seekers</span>. In <span title="juxtaposition">nearness</span> to this, were dualistic departments for the <span title="gent">courteous</span>, <span title="farant">respectable</span>, and <span title="debonair">sophisticated</span> <span title="auditors">hearers</span>. Posterior to these, were the <span title="bisexous">two-sexed</span>, <span title="rabblement">noisy crowd of low people</span>, or <span title="plebeiance">common people</span>. The male department of the latter was <span title="fraught">full</span> with - <span title="faitours">scoundrels</span>, <span title="fopdoodles">insignificant fellows</span>, <span title="boolies">tramps</span>, <span title="louts">mean fellows</span>, <span title="claw backs">flatterers</span>, <span title="kickshoes">dancers</span>, <span title="petitmaitres">fops</span>, <span title="ragabashes">rag tags</span>, <span title="rakehells">dissolutes</span>, <span title="rampallians">impertinents</span>, <span title="bumpkins">half wits</span>, <span title="jackanapes">upstarts</span>, <span title="wassailers">revelers</span>, and <span title="nincompoops">fools</span>.

        <p>The feminine department was stocked with <span title="jilts">coquettes</span>, <span title="flirtigigs">flirts</span>, <span title="fizzigs">gadders</span>, <span title="malkins">servants</span>, <span title="mauthers">foppish girls</span>, <span title="modders">fast girls</span>, <span title="tomrips">flatterers</span>, <span title="demireps">possibly unchaste women</span>, <span title="flibbergibs">sycophants</span>, and <span title="gammerstangs">awkwardly tall women</span>.

        <p>The occupants of these two departments mutually <span title="nictitated">winked</span> at their <span title="lemen">sweetheart</span>, and exhibited the most <span title="derisory">scornful</span> <span title="deport">behavior</span> towards the <span title="homilist">preacher</span>. Indeed, the <span title="jouissance">merriment</span>, <span title="enterparlance">conversation</span>, and <span title="effrenation">unruliness</span> of this <span title="posse">crowd</span> were a great <span title="crux">most important point</span> to the <span title="proximate">near</span> <span title="audients">listeners</span>. At this <span title="apathistical">unemotional</span> <span title="posse">crowd</span>, the <span title="periscopic">all around seeing</span>, <span title="argus eyed">sharp eyed</span> <span title="preachman">preacher</span> made <span title="prepotent">very powerful</span> <span title="conatus">effort</span>.

        <p>Although in this <span title="isagogical">introductory</span> part of his discourse, he <span title="disclaimed">denied</span> even a <span title="velleity">wish not strong enough to lead to action</span> towards <span title="decertation">strife</span> with any of his <span title="cotemporaries">contemporary fellows</span>, yet he <span title="delitigated">chided</span> <span title="Hylotheism">the doctrine that matter is God</span>, <span title="Islamism">Islam</span>, and <span title="Papism">Catholicism</span>; and <span title="increpated">rebuked</span> <span title="iconolaters">image worshipers</span>.

        <p>His <span title="fervency">intense feelings</span> became apparent in his <span title="aparithmesis">enumeration of parts</span>, and as he approximated the <span title="epilogue">final speech</span>, or <span title="parenetical">encouraging</span> part, and <span title="epiphonema">striking conclusion</span> of his <span title="homily">sermon</span>.

        <p>His <span title="parenesis">exhortation</span> was <span title="calid">ardent</span>. I will append to the <span title="antecedent">foregoing</span> <span title="portraiture">description</span> an <span title="excerpt">extract</span> from my <span title="itinerary">proposed route of travel</span> as noted down by me <span title="brachygraphically">by shorthand</span>.

        <p>My dear <span title="sectators">disciples</span>: - I <span title="implore">beg</span> you to cherish <span title="eupathy">right feeling</span>, and a <span title="plenary">full</span> <span title="fructure">enjoyment</span> of religion. <span title="Morigerate">Obey</span> no longer your <span title="ingenerate">inborn</span> <span title="malign">wicked</span> <span title="propensions">inclinations</span>. Enter upon <span title="theopathy">capacity for religious affections</span>, and <span title="abnegate">deny</span> your <span title="mundanity and secularity">worldliness</span>. You can yet have a <span title="pregustation">foretaste</span>, yea, a <span title="prelibation">tasting beforehand</span> of a better existence.

        <p>O ye <span title="apathistical">unemotional</span> <span title="laodiceans">lukewarm people in religion</span>! Soon, - it may be <span title="hodiurnal">of the present day</span>, - your <span title="psychomachy">soul and body conflict</span> will terminate and your <span title="foy">faith</span> be <span title="transmuted">transformed</span> into fruition. <span title="Evitate">Avoid</span> all <span title="alamodality">fashionableness</span> and <span title="recidivation">backsliding</span>; and to this end, <span title="indagate">search out</span> the <span title="hagiography">saintly writing</span> with <span title="perseverant">unwavering</span> <span title="incessancy">continuousness</span> in relation to the <span title="verity">truth</span> of these announcements. <span title="Secern">Distinguish</span> yourselves from all <span title="ludibrious">ridiculous</span> <span title="rabblements">crowds of common people</span>, and seek <span title="supersecular">heavenly</span> <span title="indefectible">unfading</span> treasures. Have your <span title="cressets">open lamps</span> and <span title="flambeaus">flaming torches</span> <span title="luminously">brightly</span> <span title="flagrant">burning</span>, and <span title="evitate">avoid</span> <span title="invigilance">carelessness</span>. But O, ye <span title="fatours">evil doers</span>, sycophantic parasites, and <span title="flibbergibs">sycophants</span>; ye <span title="sterquilinous">dirty</span> <span title="rakehells">lewd fellows</span>, <span title="rampallians">mean wretches</span>, <span title="wassailers">drunkards</span>, <span title="flirtigigs">flirts</span>, and <span title="demireps">possibly unchaste women</span>! What <span title="hortation">inciting</span> shall I impart to you? You all lie under divine <span title="execration">curses</span>, and your <span title="subastral">belo stars</span> existence is truly <span title="probationary">on trial</span> and <span title="temporaneous">temporary</span>. Divest yourselves of your <span title="imbonity">lack of goodness</span>, <span title="adiaphorism">religious indifference</span>, <span title="incognitancy">thoughtlessness</span>, and <span title="malversation">bad conduct</span>. <span title="Bonity">Goodness</span> is <span title="impetrable">obtained by petition</span>. <span title="Perpend">Consider</span> your <span title="longinquity">great distance</span> from <span title="eupathy">good feeling</span>, and <span title="inenarrable">unable to be narrated</span> sequences of your <span title="impreparation">unreadiness</span> from the <span title="approprinquating">approaching</span> <span title="catastrophe">sudden calamity</span>.

        <p>O, ye <span title="supercilious">arrogant</span> <span title="petit-maitres">dandies</span>! <span title="Conculcate">Tread on</span> the <span title="fulgid">glittering</span> <span title="ornature">ornaments</span> of your persons, and suppress your <span title="nugacities">futilities</span>, and <span title="stultiloquy">foolish talk</span>. Ye <span title="kickshoes">dancers</span>! <span title="Cease">Stop</span> your <span title="tripudiations">dances</span>. Ye <span title="wassailers">drunkards</span>! <span title="Elide">Strike out</span> your <span title="costrels">bottles</span>, and <span title="denegate">deny</span> yourselves of your <span title="vinolency">drunkenness</span>, and <span title="cretan">lying</span> practices. Ye <span title="modders">gaily dressed dandies</span>, and <span title="fopdoodles">insignificant fellows</span>; and ye <span title="clinquant">glittery</span> flirts! <span title="Abject">Cast off</span> your <span title="elamping">shining</span>, <span title="bombycinous">silken</span> <span title="habiliments">clothing</span>, and your <span title="bijoutry">trinkets</span>, and cease your irrational <span title="calamistrations">hair curlings</span>. And O, ye <span title="covetous">greedy</span> and <span title="covinous">fraudulent</span> hunks! Ye <span title="terrigenous">Earthborn</span> <span title="sept">tribe</span>! Desist from your <span title="supervacaneous">needless</span> toil and <span title="disquietudes">feelings of irritability</span>.

        <p><span title="Accede">Come</span> ye all into the <span title="stramineous">straw-like</span> department <span title="paravant">opposite</span> the <span title="rostrum">pulpit</span>. <span title="Incurvate">Bend inwards</span> your <span title="poplitics">knee joints</span>, and perform <span title="genuflection">kneeling</span>. <span title="Obsecrate">Beseech</span> that you may <span title="impetrate">obtain by prayer</span> a <span title="purgation">cleansing</span> from all your <span title="nefandous">wicked</span> <span title="piacles">offenses that require expiation</span> and <span title="abominations">disgusting acts</span>, and become <span title="impeccable">sin free</span>. If you refuse to come, you will be in a <span title="periclitation">trial</span> to suffer <span title="irremeable">unreturnable</span> <span title="relegation">banishment</span> to the <span title="cimmerian">fearfully dark</span> <span title="inframundane">underworld</span> <span title="Stygian">infernal</span> and <span title="Acherontic">gloomy</span> regions of <span title="Abaddon">Hell</span>, where your <span title="apprecations">devout wishes</span> and <span title="quiritations">cries for help</span> will be <span title="frustraneous">useless</span>, and horrendous <span title="sulphureous">brimstone</span> <span title="flagrations">flames</span> will <span title="circumgyrate">roll and whirl</span> about you, and <span title="interminable">unending</span> <span title="remordency">remorse</span> will <span title="excruciate">torment</span> you <span title="sempiternally">eternally</span>.

        <p>At this <span title="juncture">critical moment in time</span>, the <span title="influx">inflow</span> into the <span title="paleous">chaffy</span> department became ample and rapid. <span title="Conclamations">Outcries</span>, <span title="lachrymations">crying</span>, and <span title="perstreperous">noisy</span> <span title="boations">bellowings</span> became apparently, <span title="ubiquitous and omnipresential">everywhere at once</span>. The <span title="synchysis">confused mixture</span>, <span title="durdum">uproar</span>, and <span title="quassation">agitation</span> of the <span title="synaxis">congregation</span> were, according to my standard of religious <span title="credenda">articles of faith</span>, very <span title="absonant">discordant</span>, and <span title="malapropos">out of place</span>, and <span title="ergo">therefore</span>, I made my exit.

        <p><span title="Subsequently">Following this</span>, I enjoyed <span title="commensation">eating together</span> with this <span title="concionator">preacher</span> at a <span title="sybaritic">self-indulgent</span> <span title="fete">feast</span>, where he <span title="envinced">showed</span> himself an expert <span title="ornithotomist">anatomist of birds</span>, and a <span title="sapient">learned</span> <span title="deipnosophist">master of the art of dining</span> and <span title="cyclopedic">extensively learned</span> <span title="sitiologist">scientist of diet</span>, but indicated his <span title="undivested">undeprived</span> <span title="thralldom">bondage</span> to <span title="gastronomy">the art of preparing and eating good food</span>.

        <p><span title="Deeming">Consider</span> this a <span title="suffisance">sufficiency</span> of my <span title="arcane">mysterious</span> <span title="bombastry">high-sounding language</span> for the present,

        <p>I am,
        Most <span title="amicably">friendly</span> and <span title="subserviently">compliantly</span>,

        <h3>Jan. 15, 1873</h3>

        <p>Most <span title="Autodidactic">Self-taught</span> and <span title="Pedagogical">School Teaching</span> Sir: -

        <p>As my vocabulary of <span title="lexiphanic">pretentious</span> and <span title="sesquipedal">long</span> <span title="polysyllabicities">words with multiple syllables</span> is not yet exhausted, I again <span title="merge">dip</span> my <span title="plumous">feathery</span> <span title="implement">tool</span> of <span title="chirography">the art of writing</span> into <span title="atramental">inky</span> fluid for another <span title="effusion">pouring out</span> of <span title="epistolary">letter-like</span> <span title="fustian">inflated style of writing</span>.

        <p>A few fortnights <span title="prior to">before</span> the <span title="advent">arrival</span> of the <span title="hiemal">winter</span> season, I, in <span title="consociation">assocation</span> with Fritz, - a <span title="contubernial">familiar</span> <span title="belamy">good friend</span> of mine, returning from <span title="an intermontane">a between the mountains</span> <span title="venatory">hunting</span> excursion, <span title="espied">caught sight</span> in the <span title="convicinity">neighborhood</span> of <span title="an oppidan">a town</span> community, an ample concourse of the <span title="populacy">common people</span> in an <span title="apert">undisguised</span>, <span title="procere">tall</span>, and <span title="foliaceous">leafy</span> <span title="firth">grove</span>, giving <span title="audition">attention</span> to a political <span title="nestorian">wise from age</span> <span title="sermocinator">speech giver</span>.

        <p>He was a <span title="septuagenary">seventy year old</span>; and being a <span title="contuberant">candidate</span>, he was a <span title="questant">seeker</span> for their <span title="suffrages">votes</span> at their <span title="proximous, or prochein">nearest</span> <span title="ballotation">voting by ballot</span>, for <span title="nomothetical">legislative</span> dignity.

        <p>He was <span title="rugose">wrinkled</span>, <span title="pachydermatous">thick skinned</span>, slightly <span title="bisson">blind</span>, <span title="breviped">short legged</span>, <span title="tardigradous">slow</span>, and affected with partial <span title="surdity">deafness</span>, <span title="secutiency">dimness of sight</span>, <span title="caducity">feebleness of age</span>, and perceptible <span title="seity">peculiarity</span>.

        <p><span title="Archaisms">Old words</span>, <span title="exoticisms">foreign words</span>, <span title="exolete">obsolete</span> and obsolescent lingo, and <span title="fetishistic">excessively devoted</span> <span title="chauvinism">super patriotism</span>, characterized his <span title="allocution">advisory speech</span> to the <span title="conflux">crowd</span>.

        <p>He located the <span title="prelation">preference</span> of himself to his competitors, upon the <span title="chevisances">achievements</span> of the <span title="antecedaneous">former</span> part of his existence; upon his <span title="connusance">knowledge</span> of <span title="cameralistic">financial</span>, <span title="chrematistics">studies of wealth</span>, and <span title="jurisprudence">judicial law</span>; upon his <span title="consension">agreement</span> with the primordial and immaculate democracy; and especially upon his <span title="senility">deterioration due to age</span> and <span title="proleptical">far seeing</span> <span title="resipiscence">recognition of a past mistake</span>.

        <p>In the enumeration of his <span title="chevisances">achievements</span>, he furnished <span title="an ocular">a visual</span> <span title="apodixis">demonstration</span>, that he was of <span title="a doughty">an illustrious</span> and <span title="ethel">noble</span> <span title="stirp">family</span>. His <span title="ayle">grandfather</span> and <span title="eame">uncle</span> had both been <span title="bellipotent">mighty in war</span>, and of his <span title="progenitors">ancestors</span> had been <span title="consessor">associate</span> with the <span title="thesmothetes">lawgivers</span> of our nation during the formation of the national <span title="systasis">political union</span>, and rendered much <span title="adminicular">auxiliary</span> service. He was himself a <span title="ci-devant">former</span> <span title="achillean">very brave</span> <span title="cid">commander</span>, or <span title="chiliarch">commander of many men</span> of a <span title="vexillation">company of troops</span>, and for many <span title="annuary epochs">years</span>, endured the <span title="durity">harshness</span> of <span title="agminal">army marching</span> <span title="castrametation">encampment</span>, and wielded the <span title="bilbo">sword</span> in <span title="multitudinous">many</span> <span title="armisonous">resounding with arms</span> <span title="valkyrian">battle</span> <span title="concertations">strifes</span>, upon <span title="sanguifluous">blood-flowing</span> <span title="arenas">battlefields</span>.

        <p>These things were not <span title="thrasonically">boastfully</span> spoken. He <span title="averred">asserted</span> that his <span title="connusance">knowledge</span> of <span title="cameralistics">finance</span> had been <span title="utile">useful</span> to the federal compact on various emergencies. He made the <span title="indiction">declaration</span> that an <span title="ampliation">enlargement</span> of the tariff upon <span title="forinsecal">foreign</span> commodities would induce remote <span title="gubernations">governments</span> to <span title="recalcitrate">kickback</span> by passing <span title="interdictory">prohibitory</span> laws in relation to us; and as a sequence, a <span title="decurtation">cutting off</span> of our <span title="mercatantes">foreign merchants</span> would occur.

        <p>His advocacy of a <span title="minoration">decrease</span> of the tariff upon <span title="forinsecal">foreign</span> <span title="mercature">merchandise</span> was <span title="pancratic">very forcible</span>. His <span title="consension">agreement</span> with the <span title="primevous">primeval</span> <span title="democraty">democracy</span>, and his <span title="resipiscence">hard earned experience</span> from adolescence to a great <span title="provexity">advance in age</span>, were very <span title="luculent">very clear</span>.

        <p>His <span title="principia">main principles</span> are:- The <span title="minoration">decrease</span> of all <span title="extravagations">extravagances</span> and <span title="sumptuosities">high living</span> in <span title="hegemonical">controlling</span> operations, especially the <span title="supervacaneous">needless</span> <span title="guerdons">salaries</span> of the <span title="gubernative">governmental</span> functionaries; the <span title="eversion">overthrow</span> of <span title="pecunious">monied</span> <span title="synomosies">political clubs</span>; the <span title="abrogation">repeal</span> of all the <span title="dysnomies">bad laws</span> of the present <span title="dynasts">rulers</span>; the <span title="cessation">stopping</span> of the <span title="mercature">trade</span> on <span title="mutatious">borrowed</span> media; the enactment of <span title="isonomies">equal laws</span>; the <span title="depulsion">thrusting away</span> of <span title="vitiosity">wickedness</span> in the <span title="proletarian">lower</span> ranks by the enactment of <span title="salutiferous">healthful</span> laws; the deletion of popular <span title="inscience">ignorance</span>, by the erection of <span title="phrontisteries">schoolhouses</span> of all gradations. In the inferior, or <span title="propaedeutical">preparative</span>, superior and ulterior of which should be taught, - <span title="orthography">good spelling</span>, <span title="chirography">the art of writing</span>, <span title="orthoepy">good pronunciation</span>, <span title="aretology">the philosophy of virtue</span>, <span title="ontology">the philosophy of what fundamentally exists</span>, <span title="physianthropy">the philosophy of human life</span>, <span title="pathognomy">the science of human passion</span>, <span title="aristology">the science of dining</span>, <span title="ophthalmology">the science of eye diseases</span>, <span title="deontology">the science of duty</span>, <span title="geogony">the science of earth formation</span>, geography, geology, <span title="geognosy">the science of earth's structure</span>, <span title="geoscopy">knowledge of the soil</span>, <span title="oryctognosy">mineralogy</span>, <span title="zoography">animal describing</span>, <span title="trochilics">the science of rotary motion</span>, taxidermy, <span title="pneumatology">the science of air</span>, <span title="agrostology">the study of grasses</span>, economics, <span title="longimetry">the practice of distance measuring</span>, hydrodynamics, <span title="agriology">the study of tribe customs</span>, gymnastics, psychology, <span title="dietetics">the study of diets</span>, <span title="electro-biology">the study of electrical phenomena in organisms</span>, and <span title="anthroposophy">knowledge of the nature of man</span>.

        <p>He <span title="iterated">repeated</span> the <span title="asseveration">declaration</span>, that he was not a <span title="questant">seeker</span> for a participation in the <span title="guberance">administration</span> of the federation in view of <span title="ditation">union</span>; but rather, from an irrepressible conviction that a mutation in the <span title="regnant">ruling</span> powers should take place; that the <span title="extravagations">extravagances</span> and <span title="largitions">bestowal of gifts</span> of the <span title="incumbent">in office</span> <span title="dynasts">rulers</span> have <span title="effectuated">put into operation</span> a <span title="labefaction">weakening</span> of former <span title="eutaxy">good laws</span>; that his former <span title="longanimity">good natured patience</span> was exhausted; that, though <span title="longevous">living a long time</span>, he had never, in any <span title="anteriority">former part</span> of his <span title="subcelestial">life below the stars</span> being, perceived such a <span title="necessitation">need</span> for a <span title="decurtation">cutting short</span> of national <span title="fallencies">exceptions</span> as in this present <span title="secle">century</span>. He made the indication, that the present <span title="dysnomy">bad laws</span> and aspect of the federation was most <span title="luctual">saddening</span> to him; and that, as a <span title="statist">statesman</span>, he had the most <span title="sombre">gloomy</span> <span title="ominations">forebodings</span> of disastrous sequences in view of the <span title="maladministration">bad management</span>, <span title="depeculations">robberies</span>, and <span title="proditions">treachery</span> of the <span title="gubernative">governing</span> party; that he had an insatiable <span title="inhiation">craving</span> to witness the <span title="reddition">restoration</span> and <span title="prepotency">predominance</span> of pure Washingtonian and Jeffersonian democracy, or <span title="ochlocracy">mob rule</span>; and never, <span title="plutocracy">government by the rich</span>.

        <p>In the <span title="prevenient">previous</span>, or <span title="prolegomenary">introductory</span> part of his <span title="locution">speech</span>, the orator at times <span title="haffled">spoke unintelligibly</span> somewhat, but he soon became <span title="grandiloquent">pompous</span>. His <span title="senectitude">old age</span>, and the <span title="vestiges">traces</span> of <span title="anterior">former</span> <span title="debonairity">civility</span>, furnished an <span title="essoin">excuse</span> for his frequent <span title="eructations">belches</span> and <span title="exspuitions">spittings</span>.

        <p>His <span title="epilogue">closing speech</span> was <span title="apothegmatical">pithy</span>, and abounded in <span title="magniloquence">lofty speaking</span>, <span title="facundity">eloquence</span>, <span title="aristarchian">severely critical</span> and <span title="escharotic">caustic</span> <span title="pasquinade">satirical writing</span>.

        <p>I will <span title="subjoin">add</span> a <span title="paraphrastical">simplified</span> version of it as <span title="tachygraphically">shorthandedly</span> jotted down in my <span title="adversaria">notebook</span>.

        <p>O, my <span title="compatriots">fellow countrymen</span> and my <span title="constituency">representative voters</span>! Do you not <span title="espy">catch sight of</span> a crisis in your <span title="subastral">below the stars</span> <span title="vitality">life</span>, in which you should <span title="depel">dispel</span> your <span title="lethal">deathly</span> <span title="incogitancy">thoughtlessness</span>, and <span title="precogitate">think beforehand</span> your <span title="ballotation">voting by ballot</span>? Remember you are <span title="plenipotent">possessing full power</span>, aye, <span title="multipotent">having power to do many things</span> to <span title="strangulate">strangle</span> the <span title="malign">harmful</span> <span title="assuetudes">habits</span> and <span title="abusions">abuses</span> of the <span title="incumbent">in office</span> <span title="dynasts">rulers</span>. <span title="Armipotent">Mighty in battle</span> to prevent a new <span title="bevy">group</span> of <span title="parasitical">parasitic</span> <span title="politicasters">petty politicians</span> to <span title="convive">feast together</span> upon you like so many <span title="sanguisuges">bloodsuckers</span> upon <span title="insensate quadrupeds">stupid animals</span>. My competitors are nothing but <span title="empiric">experimenting</span> <span title="neonomians">advocates of new laws</span>, <span title="sciolistic">amateurish</span> <span title="parvenue">upstarts</span>, <span title="neoterics">moderns</span>, <span title="inflated">blown up</span> <span title="neophytes">beginners</span> to their party, <span title="jack-a-dandies">fops</span>; <span title="ostentous">fond of show making</span>, and unwilling to <span title="moile">labor</span>. They are far more <span title="cognizant">understanding</span> and <span title="scient">knowledgeable</span> in <span title="cicisbeism">dangling about women</span> than in civil economics jurisprudence. Their <span title="collimation">chief aim</span> is to be the <span title="beau monde">fashionable world</span>, and <span title="saginate">fatten</span> their <span title="macilent">lean</span> <span title="microcosms">little worlds</span> on the <span title="cess">tax</span> of the <span title="leod">people</span>. They are mere <span title="covinous">dishonest</span> <span title="slang-whangers">vulgar mouths</span> and <span title="skipkennels">pleasers of the vulgar</span> to a radical <span title="junto">faction</span>; mere <span title="machiavellian">cunning</span> <span title="wealsmen">statesmen</span>, whose <span title="sermocinations">speeches</span> are nothing but <span title="blandiloquence">flattery</span> and <span title="illecebrous">alluring</span> <span title="demagogism">leading of common people</span>.

        <p>They are as <span title="inane">foolish</span> of true <span title="civism">citizenship</span> as the Russian <span title="autocrat">absolute ruler</span> is of <span title="canaille">riffraff</span>. I <span title="obtestate">entreat</span> you, my senile and junior <span title="democratists">democrats</span>, to <span title="redintegrate">renew</span> the <span title="dimication">contest</span> for the <span title="eversion">overthrow</span> of radicalism, and for the rehabilitation of <span title="primordiate">primordial</span> <span title="omniparity">general equality</span> in the republic. Recall to your <span title="souvenance">remembrance</span> the <span title="pollicitations">promises</span> of the present <span title="regents">rulers</span> and their entire <span title="inanity">emptiness</span>. Would you not rather be under a <span title="gerontocracy">government by old men</span>, a <span title="neocracy">government of new officials</span>, a <span title="stratocracy">government by the military</span>, a <span title="pantisocracy">government where all rule equally</span>, or even a <span title="gynecocracy">government by women</span>, than under <span title="glavering">flattering</span> radicalism and republican <span title="timocracy">government ruled by honor</span>? I conjure you to be <span title="thoroughstitches">hustlers</span> in your <span title="colluctancy">resistance</span> to radical <span title="dition">subjection</span>. I <span title="obsecrate">beseech</span> you to <span title="abject">throw aside</span> your <span title="antecedaneous">before now</span> <span title="segnitude">sluggishness</span>; to <span title="indenizen">naturalize</span> the aliens, and be <span title="movent">on the move</span>.

        <p>Let the <span title="vexillaries">standard bearers</span> <span title="antecede">go before</span> the <span title="gradient">walking</span> column with <span title="flotant">flying</span> <span title="vexils">banners</span> inscribed with - "<span title="EUNOMY">GOOD LAWS</span> AND <span title="OMNIPARITY">GENERAL EQUALITY</span>!"

        <p>Let all the <span title="suffragists">voters</span> <span title="advene">advance</span> to the arena of <span title="ballotation">voting by ballot</span> for the <span title="ereption">snatching away</span> of the <span title="munities">security</span> of the <span title="plurality">majority</span> from the <span title="abusions">abuses</span> and <span title="proditions">treachery</span> of the <span title="incumbent">in office</span> <span title="plutocrats">rich governors</span>.

        <p>Let the radicals <span title="quassate">tremble with fear</span> like Belshazzar, and realize <span title="ubiquitary">ubiquitous</span> <span title="exauctoration">deprivation of authority</span>, <span title="extraversion">rejection</span>, <span title="ostracism">political banishment</span> and <span title="atimy">public disgrace</span>!

        <p>This <span title="peroration">exhortation</span> made the whole <span title="contesseration">assembly</span> <span title="animose">excited</span>, and <span title="elicited">brought forth</span> an <span title="euge">applause</span> <span title="potent">powerful</span> enough to <span title="lacerate">rend</span> one's <span title="auricular avenues">ear drums</span>.

        <p>The political <span title="comportation">assembly</span> then <span title="disbanded">dispersed</span>.

        <p>At this point, Fritz, - my chum, - encountered the <span title="compellation">address</span> of an <span title="apparitor">officer</span> with a <span title="capias">writ of arrest</span> or <span title="interpellation">summons</span> for him to appear at the <span title="proxime">next</span> <span title="judicatory">court of justice</span> to give <span title="responsion">answer</span> to certain <span title="allegata">criminal charges</span> <span title="divulgated">made known</span> by a certain <span title="ranchero">ranchman</span>, <span title="delator">accuser</span>.

        <p>He <span title="delated">charged</span> Fritz of <span title="clancular">secret</span> <span title="depulsion">taking away</span>, <span title="ablastion">driving away</span>, <span title="deportation">shipping</span> and <span title="vendition">selling</span> of <span title="rotherbeasts">black cattle</span>. This seemed to <span title="impinge">affect</span> Fritz like <span title="fulmination">thunder</span> and <span title="fulguration">lightning</span>; and at first, greatly <span title="tristitiated">saddened</span> him. In a <span title="peregrine">foreign</span> land, without many <span title="belamies">good friends</span>, he was in great <span title="prosternation">depression</span> relative to his situation. He however, found a <span title="mainpernor">bondsman</span>. The day of <span title="pervestigation">thorough investigation</span>, - <span title="dies juridicus">court day</span> - soon arrived. Fritz, being <span title="an alien">a stranger</span>, <span title="unkent">unknown</span>, with limited <span title="pecuniary">monetary</span> resources, a <span title="leguleian">lawyer</span> became the <span title="ultroneous">voluntary</span> <span title="susceptor">defender</span> of his cause.

        <p>This <span title="somatic">bodily</span> physique was <span title="procere">tall</span> and <span title="beauteous">handsome</span>, and his <span title="ostent">manner</span>, <span title="debonair">cultured</span>. <span title="Multiscious">Widely knowledgeable</span> in <span title="vitilitigation">frivolous litigation</span> and <span title="alethiology">the study of truth</span>; <span title="omnipercipient">perceiving everything</span>, <span title="pansophical">all-wise</span>, <span title="emissitious">narrowly examining</span>, and observant with <span title="anthroposcopy">the study of human nature</span>, <span title="metoposcopy">the study of human character from faces</span>, and <span title="dialectics">logical reasoning</span>. Without <span title="dubitancy">doubt</span>, he was <span title="a dabster">an expert</span>, a <span title="philalethist">lover of truth</span>, <span title="a cyclopedic">an extensively learned</span> <span title="quodlibetarian">person who discusses any subject at pleasure</span>, and <span title="an areopagist">a member of supreme court</span>.

        <p>His <span title="responsion">reply</span> to <span title="isagogical">introductory</span> speech of the <span title="microcephalous">little headed</span> <span title="jurist">lawyer</span> for the <span title="regime">plaintiff</span>, was <span title="consentaneous">in accord</span> with true <span title="placitory">pleading</span> dialectics, and was such a <span title="pancratic">powerful</span> <span title="cassation">making void</span> of the <span title="paralogy">false reasonings</span> of his <span title="antiloquist">contradicter</span>, that all <span title="pendency">suspense</span> relative to Fritz's being a <span title="larcener">thief</span> was <span title="douted">put out</span>.

        <p>The <span title="jurist">legal expert</span> for the <span title="polity">state</span> was a mere <span title="charlatanical">quackish</span> <span title="champertor">buyer of lawsuits</span>. His <span title="cadaverous">ghastly</span>, <span title="rugose">wrinkled</span>, <span title="cataphysical">unnatural</span>, and <span title="verrucose">warty</span> <span title="phiz">face</span>; his <span title="camoused">flattened</span> <span title="olfactor">nose</span>; his <span title="extuberant">swollen out</span> <span title="labials">lips</span>; his <span title="dolichocephalous">long-headed</span>, <span title="cirrigerous">curly</span>, somewhat <span title="ulotrichous">frizzy</span>, <span title="informous">ill shaped</span> <span title="noll">head</span>; his <span title="myopy">near sightedness</span> and <span title="strabism">squinting</span>; his <span title="edentated">toothless</span>, <span title="nicotian">tobacco-like</span> <span title="moe">mouth</span>; his <span title="macrognathic">long jawed</span>, <span title="barbigerous">bearded</span> <span title="mazard">jaw</span>; his <span title="macilent">lean</span> <span title="corporeity">body</span>; the <span title="exility">thinness</span> and <span title="marcidity">leanness</span> of his <span title="macropodous locomotives">long legs</span>; all <span title="premonstrated">showed beforehand</span> his <span title="hebetude">stupidity</span>, and was <span title="axiomatic">fundamental</span> evidence that he was not even a <span title="mediocrist">mediocre person</span>, but a mere <span title="inerudite">unlearned</span>, <span title="atechnic">not technically skilled</span>, <span title="polypragmatic">meddlesome</span> <span title="hafter">wrangler</span> and <span title="pervicacious">stubborn</span> <span title="barrator">strife maker</span>. His <span title="inscience">ignorance</span> of <span title="avital">ancestral</span> <span title="justicements">court proceedings</span>, and <span title="alethiology">study of truth</span>, and his <span title="perissology">overuse of words</span> and his <span title="battology">repetition of words</span> imparted to his <span title="tractation">handling of the subject</span> of his cause <span title="an imperspicuity">a vagueness</span> which rendered it <span title="immomentous">unimportant</span> to his <span title="juratory audients">jury</span>.

        <p>The <span title="catastasis">speech introduction</span>, or <span title="preludious">introductory</span> part of his <span title="apertion">opening</span> of the <span title="accrimination">accusation</span> was <span title="ambagitory">circuitous</span>, and <span title="catachrestical">far fetched</span>. His <span title="incapacity">inability</span> was <span title="apodeictically">self-evidently</span> conspicuous in the <span title="adduction">bringing forward</span>, <span title="adjuration">administering oaths</span>, and <span title="sciscitation">questioning</span> of these <span title="pseudo testificators">false witnesses</span>.

        <p>They were a <span title="mendacious">lying</span> <span title="clan">clique</span>, and their <span title="testifications">presentations of testimony</span> were very <span title="absonous">inharmonious</span>, and devoid of all <span title="comprobations">joint attestations</span>. In <span title="verity">truth</span>, the <span title="mendacity">lying</span> of some of the <span title="testificators">testifiers</span> was so <span title="diaphanous">clear</span> that Fritz's <span title="propugnor">defender</span> obtained from the <span title="domesman">judge</span>, or <span title="eirenarch">justice of the peace</span>, the right of <span title="compurgation">verification of oaths</span>, by the <span title="adduction">bringing forward</span> of <span title="adscititious">supplemental</span> evidence relative to some of them as <span title="deponents">witnesses</span>. In this <span title="adduction">bringing forth</span> of <span title="adminicular">aiding</span> testimony, no <span title="compurgator">persons swearing to veracity of others</span> appeared. In the final <span title="mediety">half</span> of his <span title="locution">speech</span>, there was no <span title="concatenation">connection</span> of <span title="roborant">strengthening</span> circumstances, but a mere <span title="consarcination">patchwork</span> of <span title="commentitious">imaginary</span> <span title="allegata">accusations</span>, which could never constitute a <span title="miniment">trifle</span> of any <span title="nefandous">wicked</span> <span title="piacle">offense that requires expiation</span> or <span title="anomy">disregard of law</span> in Fritz.

        <p>After many <span title="supervacaneous">needless</span> <span title="iterations">repetitions</span> of mere <span title="fingle-fangle">nonsense</span>, he <span title="commenced">began</span> to <span title="supparasite">flatter</span> the <span title="juratory bevy">jury</span> relative to their <span title="noetical">intellectual</span> <span title="habilitation">qualification</span> to <span title="sarse">sift out</span> Fritz's <span title="maleficence">evil doing</span>, and <span title="adjudicate">decide judicially</span> to <span title="ablegate">send</span> him to a <span title="lobspound">prison</span>, and have him there <span title="immured">walled in</span> and securely <span title="obserated">locked up</span>; or <span title="mulct">impose a fine on</span> him to such a <span title="pecuniary">monetary</span> amount as to make the <span title="adeption">obtaining</span> of the <span title="fidejussor">guarantor</span> <span title="impracticable">unworkable</span>; thereby effecting his <span title="expulsion">banishment</span> from the <span title="convicinity">neighborhood</span>.

        <p>Thus he <span title="dawdled">wasted time</span>; and such was his <span title="insulsity">stupidity</span>, <span title="morology">nonsense</span>, <span title="jejunity">unsophisticatedness</span>, and the <span title="nebulosity">cloudiness</span> of his <span title="harns">brains</span>, that he could not perceive the <span title="derisive">mocking</span> <span title="ludification">deriding</span> of his <span title="audients">hearers</span>.

        <p>He seemed to be <span title="inimicitious">unfriendly</span> and <span title="acerb">embittered</span> towards Fritz in his <span title="agrestic">rural</span> <span title="russet">dress</span>, through mere <span title="prosopolepsy">judging character from external appearance</span>.

        <p>The <span title="replication">reply</span> of Fritz's <span title="legist">attorney</span> to this <span title="badinage">banter</span>, notwithstanding his <span title="pauciloquy">few words</span>, was <span title="anatreptic">overpowering</span>, <span title="elenctical">refuting</span>, <span title="prepotent">very forceful</span>, and <span title="replete with">full of</span> the most <span title="pyrotic">caustic</span> <span title="pasquinade">satirical writing</span>. He <span title="eclaircised">made clear</span> all the <span title="nodose">knotty</span> aspects in the <span title="accrimination">criminal accusation</span>, and <span title="evinced">showed</span> Fritz's <span title="columbine">dove-like</span> <span title="innocency">innocence</span>; that the <span title="delator's">accuser's</span> <span title="testificators">witnesses</span> were a most <span title="mendacious">untruthful</span> <span title="cretan">lying</span> <span title="sept">clan</span>; that the <span title="delation">accusation</span> contained <span title="a plenitude">an abundance</span> of <span title="pseudologies">falsehoods</span> and <span title="maledicencies">slanders</span>; and that the <span title="querent">plaintiff</span> was an egotistical <span title="morosoph">learned fool</span>, and <span title="dedolent">apathetic</span> <span title="scelerat">criminal</span>; prompted wholly in the <span title="delation">accusation</span> by an <span title="indomitable">invincible</span> <span title="misanthropy">hatred for mankind</span> and <span title="philistinism">hatred of culture</span>; and that he was entitled to a <span title="nihility">nothingness</span>, or <span title="nullibiety">state of being nowhere</span>. In <span title="verity">truth</span>, that the entire procedure was illegal; and that, from <span title="praecognita">things previously known</span>, and precedence he demanded not only an <span title="absolutory">absolving</span> <span title="acquittal">judgement of not guilty</span>, an <span title="unextorted">unforced</span> <span title="assoilzie">setting free</span> and <span title="deraignment">clearing oneself</span>. Not only so, but a considerable <span title="pecuniary">monetary</span> <span title="assythment">indemnification for injury</span>, as Fritz's absolute, and <span title="jural">just and natural</span> <span title="droit">right</span>.

        <p>The <span title="arbitrament">decision</span>, or <span title="adjudication">verdict</span> of the <span title="judicature">court</span> was <span title="proficuous">useful</span> to Fritz. In a jiffy, the whole <span title="comportation">assembly</span> emitted into the aerial vault the most <span title="conclamatory">outcrying</span> and congratulatory <span title="boations">bellowing</span>, and <span title="effunded">poured out</span> upon the <span title="ranchero">ranchman</span> the <span title="plethoric">excessively plentiful</span> <span title="cornucopia">abundance</span> of their <span title="ire">anger</span>. The <span title="redacteurs">revisers</span> and <span title="diurnalists">journalists</span> gave Fritz's arraignment and <span title="adjudication">trial</span>, <span title="divulgation">publishing</span> and <span title="evulgation">divulging</span>; which invested him with <span title="moliminous">very important</span> and <span title="imperdible">indestructible</span> <span title="famosity">notoriety</span>.

        <p>More <span title="anon">quickly</span>.

        <p>Most <span title="immutably">unchangingly</span>,

        <p>Being again moved with something like <span title="cacoethes scribendi">an itch for writing</span>, I call into <span title="requisition">order</span> my <span title="escritorial">writing desk</span> <span title="furnishments">materials</span> to <span title="delineate">precisely outline</span> for you, <span title="in minutiae">in all minor details</span>, my experience at a <span title="sybaritic">luxurious</span> <span title="nuptial">marriage</span> <span title="ambigu">buffet</span>, and the <span title="concomitant">accompanying</span> <span title="momentous">important</span> <span title="sequences">results</span>.

        <p>Fritz and I returning from a negotiatory trip to the <span title="hesperian">western</span> <span title="megalopolis">main city</span>, arrived, in the <span title="post-meridian">afternoon</span> part of the day, in a <span title="visne">neighborhood</span>.

        <p>Having <span title="approximated">approached</span> a <span title="hostelry">lodging house</span> of <span title="imposing">impressive</span> and <span title="delectable">pleasing</span> appearance, we discovered that every <span title="concomitant">accompanying thing</span> of the establishment was undergoing a general <span title="depuration">purification</span>. All the <span title="factotums">odd-job assistants</span> about the <span title="hacienda">fine farm</span> were <span title="sedulously">diligently</span> employed. I made a <span title="circumspective">cautious</span> <span title="pedetentous">gradually progressing</span> <span title="reconnoitering">surveying</span> tour of inspection to the <span title="posterior">rear</span> department of the <span title="extruction">building</span>, where I <span title="espied">caught sight of</span> the most <span title="sanguinary">bloody</span> scenes. There took place the <span title="trucidation">killing</span> of <span title="pennigerous bipeds">birds</span> by <span title="decollation">beheading</span>; of <span title="vituline">calf-like</span>, <span title="ovine">sheep-like</span>, <span title="curvicaudate">curly tailed</span>, <span title="suilline, or porcine">pig-like</span>, and other <span title="crinigerous">hairy</span> and <span title="lanigerous">woolly</span> <span title="quadrupeds">four legged animals</span>, by the <span title="exantlation">drawing out</span> of their <span title="sanguineous fluid">blood</span>. Some of the <span title="plumigerous">feathered</span> and <span title="aligerous">winged</span> <span title="bipeds">two footed animals</span> were undergoing <span title="deplumation">plucking</span> or deprivation of their <span title="indument">coverings</span> by <span title="decerption">plucking</span>.

        <p>Some of the <span title="strigillose">bristly</span> and <span title="piligerous">hairy</span> <span title="quadrupeds">four footed creatures</span> were in a process of <span title="excoriation">skinning</span>, and others subject to a <span title="depilatory eventeration">hair removal process</span>, and <span title="trutination, or ponderation">weighing</span>.

        <p>The <span title="propinquity">nearness</span> of these operations to my visual powers, <span title="evocated">evoked</span> in me the conviction that <span title="an epulation">a feast</span> was <span title="approximating">near at hand</span>; and being somewhat <span title="scrutinous">thorough</span> and inquisitive, I received <span title="cognoscence">awareness</span> that on the <span title="proximate">next</span> day a <span title="sponsal">wedding</span> <span title="epulation">feast</span> was to occur.

        <p>In <span title="confabulation">casual conversation</span> with the <span title="homiletical">talkative</span> and <span title="hospitable">welcoming</span> host <span title="antecedent">prior</span> to <span title="couchee">late evening reception</span>, Fritz and he produced, in the progress of their <span title="enterparlance">conversation</span>, mutual and <span title="indubious">undoubted</span> <span title="genealogical">family descending</span> <span title="apodixis">proof</span>, that they stood in relation of cater cousins to each other. In consequence of his great seniority to Fritz, and his early <span title="emigration">moving out</span> from home, they had <span title="anterior">prior</span> to that evening been in a state of <span title="nescience">ignorance</span> to each other.

        <p>Our <span title="concinnity">agreeableness</span> of <span title="abearance">manners</span>, and his great <span title="comity">civility</span> and <span title="xenodochy">hospitality</span>, as well as his <span title="consanguinity">same-bloodedness</span> to Fritz <span title="educed">brought forth</span> from him an invitation to us to participate in the <span title="hilarity">merriment</span> of the approaching <span title="nuptials">wedding</span>.

        <p>The parties to be concatenated were his senior daughter and a <span title="rurigenous">country-born</span> <span title="gent">gentleman</span> <span title="visne">village</span>.

        <p>On the <span title="nuptial">wedding</span> day, at the <span title="horal">hourly</span> designation, the guests arrived at the mansion, in <span title="wains">wagons</span>, <span title="curricles">buggies</span>, and other <span title="vehiculary">vehicular</span> <span title="voiture">conveyances</span>; upon <span title="montures">saddle horses</span>, <span title="yawds">ordinary horses</span>, <span title="plugs">jades</span>, <span title="bronchos">Mexican ponies</span>, <span title="burros">donkeys</span>, and <span title="equine">horse</span> <span title="hybrids">crosses</span> with abnormally <span title="elongated">lengthened</span> <span title="auricular appendages">ears</span>. There were, also, <span title="multitudinous">many</span> <span title="pedestrians">walkers</span>.

        <p>The <span title="puisne">junior</span> folk of both genders exhibited themselves in the <span title="optimity">best state</span> of their attire.

        <p>Ultimately the <span title="ecclesiastic">preacher</span> who was to <span title="colligate">bind</span> the parties <span title="indissoluble">lasting</span> <span title="conjugium">binding marriage tie</span> with the <span title="infrangible">unbreakable</span> <span title="gyves">shackles</span> of <span title="Hymen">the god of marriage</span>, arrived.

        <p>He was <span title="octogenarian">between 80 and 89 years old</span>. His <span title="sable">dark</span> <span title="envelopes">clothes</span>; his <span title="lugubrious">mournful</span> <span title="countenance">appearance</span>; the <span title="rugosity">wrinkledness</span> of his <span title="visnomy">face</span>; his <span title="depilous">bald</span> cranium; the <span title="rotundity">roundness</span> of his person; the <span title="gracility">graceful slenderness</span> of his <span title="crural organs">legs</span>; and his <span title="ampulliform">flask shaped</span> <span title="olfactor">nose</span>, engaged my <span title="optics">eyes</span> exceedingly.

        <p>He <span title="coalesced">united</span> the interests of the <span title="amorous">loving</span> pair by <span title="confarreation">Roman marriage ceremony</span>, and immediately after the <span title="espousals">marriage</span>, <span title="anacamtic">resounding</span> <span title="tintinnabulations">bell ringings</span> from the <span title="refectory department">communal dining room</span>, anounced a change in the programme. In a <span title="brevity">shortness</span> of time, the doors of the <span title="refectory">dining room</span> were made <span title="patulous">open</span>, and the <span title="mensal">table</span> board <span title="onerated">loaded</span> with <span title="prog">various foods</span>, <span title="cates">delicacies</span>, <span title="succades">sweetmeats</span>, and in <span title="verity">truth</span> <span title="a superabundance">an excess</span> of <span title="omnifarious">various</span> <span title="cibarious">edible</span> <span title="comestibles">foods</span>, displayed itself to dazzled eyes and <span title="esurient">inclined to eat</span> <span title="maws">mouths</span>. This <span title="mensal structure">table</span> was soon <span title="environed">surrounded</span> by <span title="carls">churls</span>, <span title="chuffs">clowns</span>, <span title="clodpates">blockheads</span>, <span title="clumps">clumsy fellows</span>, <span title="coggers">deceivers</span>, <span title="galliards">carefree men</span>, <span title="rancheros">ranchmen</span>, <span title="vaqueros">herdsmen</span>, <span title="tauromachians">bull fighters</span>, <span title="hoidens">rude girls</span>, <span title="hunks">misers</span>, <span title="noodles">simpletons</span>, <span title="dicacious">talkative</span> <span title="citesses">city women</span>, <span title="abigails">lady's waiting-maids</span>, <span title="oppidans">townsmen</span>, <span title="rustics">country folks</span>, <span title="verecundious">modest</span> <span title="bonnibels">handsome girls</span>, <span title="bonnilasses">beautiful girls</span>, <span title="floricomous">flower adorned</span> <span title="whiting-mops">fair lasses</span>, <span title="pickthanks">officious people</span>, <span title="poltroons">cowards</span>, <span title="rantipoles">roving people</span>, <span title="terraculturists">agriculturists</span>, <span title="skipjacks">upstarts</span>, <span title="tosspots">drunkards</span>, <span title="senoritas">beauties</span>, <span title="bas bleus">intellectual women</span>, and <span title="erubescent">blushing</span> misses of <span title="ineffable">indescribable</span> <span title="pulchritude">beauty</span>.

        <p>So soon as a <span title="rogation">solemn supplication</span> for a <span title="benison">blessing</span> by the <span title="concionator">preacher</span>, <span title="transpired">came to be known</span>, <span title="fourchette">table forks</span>, and all implements for the transportation of <span title="prog">various food</span> from the table to <span title="oral apertures">mouths</span>, were <span title="movent">on the move</span> and <span title="sonorific">producing sound</span>. Such <span title="abligurition">prodigal expense of food</span>; such <span title="lycanthropic">wolfish</span> <span title="edacity">greediness</span>, <span title="lurcation">gluttony</span>, <span title="ingurgitation">greedy swallowing</span> and <span title="gulosity">greediness</span>; such <span title="omnivorousness">eating of anything</span> and <span title="pantophagy">eating of everything</span>; and such a <span title="mutation">change</span> and <span title="avolation">flying away</span> of <span title="comestibles">foods</span>, had never fallen under my vision in any <span title="antecedent">prior</span> part of my <span title="sublunary entity">life beneath the moon</span>. Truly, <span title="anamnestic">reminiscent</span> of Byron's <span title="dura illia messorum!">O, ye 'tough insides' of reapers!</span>

        <p>The <span title="fabaceous">bean-like</span> and other <span title="esculent">edible</span> supplies had undergone thorough <span title="elixation">boiling</span>. The <span title="supernaculum">fine wine</span> and other <span title="poculent">fit for drink</span> liquids had been well <span title="edulcorated">sweetened</span>. The <span title="gallimaufries">hashes</span>, <span title="olla podrida">hodgepodge</span>, <span title="ragouts">meat vegetable stews</span>, and <span title="salmagundi">potpourri</span>, were all well <span title="condited">preserved</span>, and were <span title="delectable">delightful</span>; giving quite <span title="an acuity">a keenness</span> to the <span title="gusto">appetite</span> of the eaters.

        <p>After the <span title="epigastrics">stomachs</span> of all had been duly <span title="sated">fed beyond desire</span>, and the <span title="appurtenances">things belonging</span> of the <span title="mensal">table</span> board had been removed, <span title="an epithalamium">a marriage song</span> and other <span title="ariettas">musical pieces written for a solo voice with orchestral accompaniment in an opera or cantata</span> and <span title="chansonnettes">little songs</span> were chanted by the junior portion of the <span title="convivialists">drunkards</span>. This part of the programme was unceremoniously interrupted by <span title="an uproarious">a very noisy</span> <span title="callithumpian">riotous parade-like</span> <span title="charivari">mock serenade</span> by an <span title="omnium-gatherum">hodgepodge</span> <span title="rabblement">crowd of common people</span> of the <span title="vicinage">surrounding districts</span>.

        <p>We all then took <span title="consession">sitting together</span> in a spacious <span title="aularian">hall-like</span> saloon. Fritz and I were soon the <span title="cynosures">centers of attention</span> and objects of their <span title="oeillades">suggestive glances</span>, as <span title="peregrine">foreign</span> aliens in their midst. I saw them <span title="nictate">wink</span> and <span title="susurrate">whisper</span>, and they seemed much <span title="titillated">amused</span> at our <span title="neoteric">recent</span> appearance among them. We, however, disregarded their <span title="abderian">foolish</span> <span title="ludifications">gigglings</span>. When the parson had withdrawn, they <span title="inchoated">began</span> <span title="saltation">dancing</span>, which some performed with considerable <span title="legerity">nimbleness</span>; especially, the <span title="presultor">leader of the dance</span>.

        <p>Those of the feminine gender, appeared in the <span title="optimity">best state</span> of their attractions. The <span title="tetes">wigs</span> of some had undergone much unique and artistic <span title="capillature">frizzing</span>; and the <span title="capital">head</span> <span title="crinitory">hairy</span> <span title="filaments">fibres</span> of others had been so <span title="crispated">curled</span> by the instruments of <span title="tonsorial">barber</span> <span title="friseurs">hairdressers</span>, as to resemble the <span title="spiral">winding</span> <span title="flexures">curls</span> of the <span title="caudal extremity">tail</span> of a <span title="porcine quadruped">pig</span>. Their <span title="chapeaus">hats</span> were gorgeously <span title="plumed">adorned with bright feathers</span>, and <span title="hyperbolically">exaggerated</span> and <span title="fulgidly">brilliantly</span> <span title="ornated">ornamented</span>. Their <span title="sericeous">silky</span> <span title="fazzolets">handkerchiefs</span> and <span title="bombycinous">silky</span> <span title="mokadours">handkerchiefs</span> were brilliant and highly <span title="odorated">odorous</span>. Their faces had been <span title="rubricated">marked with red</span> and <span title="infucated">stained</span> with <span title="fucus">paint</span>. Indeed they exhibited such flirtation that almost affected me with <span title="misogyny">women hatred</span>.

        <p>Fritz and I <span title="exhilarated">entertained</span> a knot of guests with <span title="orphean">entrancing</span> <span title="strains">music portions</span> upon the <span title="guimbard">jew's harp</span>; and with <span title="bon mots">clever remarks</span>, quips, and <span title="rebuses">puzzles with language encoded as pictures</span>; and rendered other <span title="auxiliations">assistance</span>, to the best of our <span title="appropriaments">peculiar qualifications</span>; but we did not <span title="tripudiate">dance</span>, or participate in any <span title="gallimatias">senseless talk</span>.

        <p>When all had received <span title="satiation">satisfaction</span> as to the <span title="diversified">varied</span> amusements, especially, <span title="terpsichorean">dancing-related</span> indulgence, the <span title="coterie">ingroup</span> disbanded. At one time, all were hugely <span title="conquassated">shaken up</span> by the diffusion of some <span title="pulverized">powdered</span> <span title="mundungus">stinking tobacco</span> on the floor.

        <p>I indulged in a <span title="permansion">continuance</span> with Fritz's <span title="complaisant">genial</span> and <span title="harberous">hospitable</span> <span title="german">kinsman</span> for the <span title="diuturnity">long duration</span> of a fortnight.

        <p>During this <span title="tarriance">delay</span>, I witnessed much of a very <span title="momentous">significant</span> <span title="import">importance</span>.

        <p>The <span title="nimiety">excess</span> and <span title="superalimentation">overfeeding</span> of <span title="multifarious">various</span> <span title="cibarious">food-related</span> substances engorged into <span title="inane">empty</span> and <span title="jejune">lacking nutritive value</span> stomachs during the <span title="nuptial">marital</span> festivity, were extremely <span title="nosopoetic">disease producing</span>, and some of the guests were ferried, - <span title="nolens volens">willing or unwilling</span>, - by <span title="Charon">the ferryman at the river Styx</span>, over the <span title="river Styx">river in the lower world</span>.

        <p>The <span title="morbific">disease causing</span> character of the <span title="maladies">diseases</span> became manifest variously in their physical organization. Some were seized with <span title="deuteropathy">a headache from an overloaded stomach</span>; some with <span title="ephialtes">nightmare</span>; others with <span title="apepsy">indigestion</span>, <span title="emesis">vomiting</span>, <span title="megrim">migraine</span>, <span title="epistaxis">nosebleed</span>, or <span title="sanguineous">bloody</span> <span title="manations">flowing outs</span> from their <span title="nasal orifices">nostrils</span>; some were affected with <span title="gingival">gum</span> and <span title="hepatical">liver</span> <span title="intumescence">swelling</span> and <span title="lippitude">soreness of eyes</span>; others were beset with <span title="catalepsy">a trance-like state with loss of voluntary motion and failure to react to stimuli</span>, <span title="subitaneous">sudden</span> <span title="lipothymy">fainting</span>, succeeded by <span title="subsultory">jerking</span> <span title="exagitations">agitations</span>; in others were generated <span title="dyspnoea">difficulty with respiration</span>, <span title="aglutition">difficulty with swallowing</span>, <span title="distension">expanding</span> of the <span title="pericardium">membrane surrounding the heart</span> and <span title="pneumonia">inflammation of the lungs</span>, induced by <span title="saltation">dancing</span> and <span title="inhalation">breathing in</span> of <span title="pulverized">powdered</span> <span title="nicotian">tobacco</span>.

        <p>Couriers were <span title="ablegated">sent on a special mission</span> from all parts of the <span title="villatic">village</span> community to secure <span title="adjuments">supports</span> of the <span title="pharmacopolists">medicine sellers</span>, <span title="chirurgeons">surgeons</span>, physicians, and even <span title="Hobson's choice">the choice of taking all offered or nothing</span> <span title="charlatans">quacks</span> and <span title="amethodists">those without method</span>.

        <p>In their <span title="diagnostications">diagnoses</span> and <span title="prognostications">predictions</span>, and their discovering <span title="procatarctic">exciting</span> causes, and prescribing, there was no <span title="consimilitude">similarity</span>. Not all of them were professionally versed and skilled in <span title="materia medica">pharmacology</span>, and the medical and surgical departments of <span title="pathology">the science of diseases</span>; - <span title="nosology">the science of disease causes</span>, <span title="aetiology">the science of disease causes</span>, morbid anatomy, <span title="symptomatology">the science of symptoms</span>, and therapeutics; and as a sequence, some of them shot wide of the mark as to <span title="pathognomic">human passion science</span> symptoms.

        <p>When I brought my <span title="zetetic">inquiring</span> <span title="Aesculapian">healing</span> battery to bear upon one of them, I discovered he could not differentiate among <span title="maladies">diseases</span> - <span title="epidemic">wide spreading</span>, <span title="endemic">locally spreading</span>, and <span title="sporadic">irregularly spreading</span>; infectious and contagious.

        <p>The one who officiated in the vicinity of the <span title="hacienda">fine farm</span>, imparted the following <span title="pharmaceutical recipes">prescriptions</span>:-

        <p>For <span title="megrim">migraine</span> and <span title="lippitude">soreness of the eyes</span>, - <span title="acupuncturation">acupuncture</span>, and <span title="scarification">scarring</span> on the <span title="cutaneous">skin</span> <span title="integument">covering</span> of the <span title="cranium">head</span>; for <span title="lipothymy">fainting</span>, the <span title="extravasation">passing out</span> of the <span title="rubric">ruby red</span> fluid by <span title="venesection">vein cutting</span>, or <span title="phlebotomy">surgical incision into the vein</span>; for <span title="subsultory">leaping</span> <span title="exagitations">agitations</span>, a <span title="sudatory">sweat-related</span> <span title="diaphoretics">perspiration producers</span>, and <span title="hypnotics">sleep producers</span>; for <span title="nasal hemorrhage">nose bleeding</span>, <span title="styptics">astringent drugs</span> applied to the <span title="rhinal">nasal</span> <span title="emunctory">organ that carries off waste matter</span>; for <span title="imposthumations">abscesses</span>, - <span title="argillaceous">clayey</span> <span title="illutations">smearing of the body</span>; for <span title="ephialtes">the nightmare</span>, <span title="apepsy">indigestion</span>, and <span title="deuteropathy">headache from an overloaded stomach</span>, - <span title="antephialtics">medicines against nightmares</span>, <span title="Baunscheidtism">skin rubbing acupuncture</span>, and <span title="calefacient">warming</span> <span title="sinapisms">blistering plasters</span>; for <span title="iliac">ilium and bowel related</span> <span title="disquietudes">feelings of irritability</span>, - <span title="stingo">strong old beer</span> <span title="immixed">mixed</span> with ginger and cayenne pepper; for <span title="aglutition, or dysphagy">inability to swallow</span>, - <span title="oesophagotomy">incision through the oesophagus</span>; for <span title="dyspnoea">breathing difficulties</span>, - <span title="bronchotomy, or pharyngotomy">incision through the windpipe</span>.

        <p>Should all these fail, or prove <span title="inutile">useless</span>, he insisted on an <span title="adhibition">application</span>, as a <span title="succedaneum">substitution medicine</span> and <span title="adjuvant">helping medicine</span>, of an <span title="apozem">infusion</span>, or <span title="excoction">boiling out</span> of <span title="hederaceous">ivy-like</span> and other <span title="radicals">roots</span> and <span title="corticals">barks</span>, which, <span title="depurated">cleansed</span> of <span title="lees">dregs</span> by <span title="percolation">filtering</span>, or <span title="transcolation">straining</span>, and well <span title="dulcorated">sweetened</span>, would lose its <span title="injucundity">unpleasantness</span> and become totally <span title="innocuous">harmless</span>. With this <span title="apozemical">decoction-resembling</span> treatment should be connected <span title="eccritics">discharge promoting medicines</span>, or drastic <span title="deobstruents">medicines opening body ducts</span> and <span title="emetics">medicines inducing vomiting</span>. <span title="Ingeminations">Repetitions</span> of very <span title="calefacient">warming</span> <span title="epispastics">blistering plasters</span>, and <span title="copious">plentiful</span> <span title="phlebotomy">incision into a vein</span> should be <span title="sedulously">diligently</span> <span title="protracted">drawn out</span> until the <span title="invaletudinarian">patient</span> became almost <span title="exsanguinous">bloodless</span> and <span title="evanid">faint</span>, anemic and <span title="thanatoid">deathlike</span> - <span title="autoptically">seen with one's own eyes</span> <span title="exanimate">lifeless</span>. Should a patient, from <span title="sudations">sweating</span>, <span title="venesections">bloodletting</span>, <span title="vesicants">blisterings</span>, and other <span title="cutaneous">skin</span> appliances, became <span title="sweltry">sweltering</span>, <span title="adhibitions">applications</span> of <span title="aqueous">watery</span> <span title="aspersions">sprinklings</span> upon the epidermis, should be <span title="sedulously">diligently</span> secured.

        <p>He <span title="asseverated">asserted</span> that these <span title="medicamental">medicinal</span> appliances would have the most <span title="salutiferous">health producing</span> syndrome; and that after <span title="an imminution">a decrease</span> of the patient's obesity by strict <span title="limotherapeia">fasting</span>, his <span title="abstersed">cleansed</span>, <span title="emaciated">wasted away</span>, and <span title="adynamic">debilitated</span> system might be <span title="instaurated">restored</span> with <span title="cardiacs">heart medicines</span> and <span title="peptic sauces">digestive medicines</span>. He <span title="iterated">repeated</span> the assertion that from the proficiency in <span title="angiography">the study of blood vessels and lymphatics</span>, <span title="pharmacodynamics">the study of drug effects and mechanisms of action</span>, <span title="threpsology">the study of nutrition</span>, <span title="therapeutics">the study of disease treatment</span>, and <span title="prophylactics">medicines which slow the course of an illness</span>, he knew the employment of this <span title="medicamental">medicinal</span> treatment would make <span title="sanation">restoration to health</span> certain.

        <p>He <span title="impignorated">pledged</span> his <span title="veracity">truthfulness</span> that the patient would be invested with an almost <span title="immarcescible">unfading</span> <span title="floriage">bloom</span>; and that, in his <span title="supputation">account</span> with them, he would not be <span title="scrupulously">conscientiously</span> exacting as to <span title="lucrific">gainful</span> <span title="guerdon">reward</span>. In <span title="diametrical">polar</span> <span title="oppugnancy">opposition</span> to his <span title="Aesculapian">healing</span> skill and the <span title="remedial">rectifying</span> treatment with <span title="diacatholicons">universal remedies</span>, <span title="polychrests">medicines that have many uses</span>, and <span title="adiaphorous">neutral</span> placebos, some of the <span title="maladies">diseases</span> were <span title="mortiferous">deadly</span>, and several of the <span title="puisne">younger</span> folks were soon <span title="irremediably">incurably</span> <span title="moribund">at death's door</span>, and made their exit for the <span title="irremeable">returnless</span> <span title="bourne">goal</span>, - <span title="Erebus">The space through which souls pass to Hades</span> and the realms of <span title="sprites">spirits</span>.

        <p>The <span title="amethodist's">quack's</span> <span title="medicamenta">drugs</span> were so <span title="narcotic">stupor inducing</span> and <span title="lethiferous">fatal</span>, that the victims of his <span title="indexterity">clumsiness</span>, in the <span title="ultimity">finality</span> of their <span title="terrestrial vitality">life on Earth</span>, were favoured with <span title="euthanasy">easy death</span>.

        <p>The <span title="hilarity">merry-making</span> of the <span title="nuptial">marital</span> <span title="epulation">feasting</span> merged into <span title="lugubrious">mournful</span> aspects. <span title="Resplendent">Splendid</span> <span title="habiliments">attire</span> were succeeded by <span title="sable">jet black</span> <span title="paraphernalia">miscellaneous articles</span> of <span title="obsequies">funeral rites</span>; and the <span title="cantata">musical composition based on religious texts</span> of <span title="jovialities">joy</span> were followed by <span title="exequial">funereal</span> <span title="arvals">feasts</span> and <span title="epicedian">funereal</span> <span title="threnodes">songs</span>. And O, the <span title="cadent">falling</span> <span title="lachrymary">tearful</span> <span title="effusions">outpourings</span> of the <span title="clonic">convulsed</span> and <span title="clamant">earnestly crying</span> <span title="ging">crowd</span>!

        <p>The <span title="medicus">doctor</span> <span title="commingled">mixed together</span> with the <span title="suspiring">sighing</span> <span title="threnetic">mournful</span> <span title="throng">crowd</span> in the <span title="procession">march</span> to the <span title="necropolis">graveyard</span> for the <span title="inhumation">burial</span> of the <span title="decedents">deceased people</span>; by notwithstanding his <span title="fletiferous">tearful</span> <span title="crocodility">affected sorrow</span>, he maintained the most astounding <span title="adiaphory">indifference</span> and <span title="ataraxy">calmness</span>.

        <p><span title="Subsequent to">After</span> the <span title="sepelition">burial</span> of the <span title="reliquiae">remains of the dead</span>, he exhibited his <span title="carte blanche">blank pieces of paper with signatures</span>, <span title="variegated">varied</span> with <span title="multitudinous">multiple</span> numerical <span title="additaments">additions</span>; - most <span title="ocularly">by eyesight</span> <span title="indicant">evident</span> of his <span title="questuary">profit seeking</span>, <span title="covetous">very desirous</span>, and <span title="covinous">deceitful</span> <span title="proclivities">inclinations</span>.

        <h2>Mesquite <span title="Boscage">Grove</span>, <span title="Occident">West</span></h2>
        <h3>June 1, 1873</h3>

        <p>Most <span title="bibliophilistical">book loving</span> Sir:-

        <p>In the <span title="finale">concluding part</span> of my <span title="primal">primary</span> <span title="lexiphanic">pretentious</span> <span title="epistolography">letter</span>, I <span title="imparted">communicated</span> to you the <span title="verity">truth</span>, that <span title="femininity">womanliness</span> had not <span title="effascinated">charmed</span> me. Not so, however, as to my chum, Fritz. He does not believe that - <span title="amare et sapere vix deo conceditur">to love and be wise is scarcely permitted even to a god</span>; - and consequently, he is about to become a <span title="neogamist">person recently married</span>, by being <span title="colligated">bound</span> with <span title="hymeneal">marital</span> <span title="fetters">shackles</span>. He will doubtless soon be the <span title="beatific">blissful</span> occupant of his own <span title="hacienda">fine farm</span>, <span title="environed">surrounded</span> by the <span title="maximum">greatest</span> of <span title="paradisiacal">paradise-like</span> <span title="subcelestial">under the heaven</span> <span title="felicity">happiness</span>.

        <p>Without much <span title="circuity">indirectness</span>, I will give you the <span title="concatenation">string</span> of circumstances leading to the present status of his <span title="amatorial">love making</span> venture, - and <span title="imprimis">in the first place</span>, give you a <span title="laconic">brief</span> <span title="biographic">life history</span> sketch of Fritz.

        <p>He was, during his <span title="adolescency">adolescence</span>, a <span title="paralian">dweller by the sea</span>.

        <p>His ancestral <span title="habitation">occupancy</span> was <span title="conterminous">neighboring</span> to the <span title="maritimal">maritime</span> sections of this <span title="splendrous">splendid</span> columbian republic, where the <span title="congestion">denseness</span> of population and the <span title="celsitude">highness</span> of the means for the <span title="sustentation">sustainment</span> of <span title="vitality">life</span>, necessitated those who had, by <span title="herculean">extremely difficult</span> and invincible difficulties, become <span title="depauperated">impoverished</span>, to <span title="emigrate">move out</span> to the <span title="untenanted">unoccupied</span> portions of our <span title="occidental">western</span> domain.

        <p>Often he could not <span title="evitate">avoid</span> the <span title="emission">discharge</span> of the most grave <span title="suspirations">sighs</span> in view of the <span title="atrabilarian">melancholic</span> aspects of his <span title="natal">native</span> <span title="vicinity">neighborhood</span>, and of the <span title="unswayable">ungovernable</span> <span title="approximation">approach</span> of the <span title="detorsion">twisting</span> from the <span title="operatives">laborers</span>, of the media of obtaining a <span title="competency">livelihood</span>, by <span title="opulent">deluxe</span> <span title="monopolies">companies controlling trade</span>.

        <p>However <span title="sedulous">thorough</span> in any <span title="avocation">minor occupation</span>, but few could participate in the reception of correspondent <span title="remunerative">financially rewarding</span> <span title="guerdon">recompense</span>.

        <p>The <span title="incessant">unstopping</span> <span title="crescive">gradually and spontaneously growing</span> density of the <span title="transmontane">beyond the mountains</span> population <span title="impelled">forced</span> the <span title="proprietors">owners</span> of <span title="terra firma">land</span> to such constant <span title="ingeminate">repeated</span> <span title="arations">ploughings</span> and <span title="inseminations">seed sowings</span> of their <span title="granges">farms</span> for the <span title="eduction">drawing out</span> of <span title="radical">rooty</span>, <span title="herbaceous">herby</span>, <span title="leguminous">pulsey</span>, and <span title="frumentarious">wheaty and grainy</span> <span title="cerealia">cereals</span>, that <span title="terrene">earthy</span> <span title="infecundity">barrenness</span>, even of the most <span title="batful">fertile</span> soils, inevitably resulted.

        <p>Not only so, but the <span title="discinding">cutting up</span> of the <span title="granges">farms</span> into <span title="exiguous">narrow</span>, <span title="multangular">many cornered</span>, and <span title="multilateral">many sided</span> fragments, made them too <span title="angust">narrow</span> for occupancy. A mature <span title="cogitation">deliberation</span> upon the <span title="accreting">growing together</span> <span title="congeries">aggregations</span> of the <span title="discommodities">inconveniences</span> in prospect for his <span title="natal">native</span> land, brought him to the <span title="acturience">impulse to act</span> to <span title="effectuate">effect</span> a <span title="segregation">separation</span> of himself from the localities that witnessed the <span title="gambols">sportive pranks</span> of his <span title="juvenility">youth</span>, and <span title="procure">acquire</span> for himself a <span title="domiciliation">permanent residence</span> in the <span title="spacious">roomy</span> <span title="occident">west</span>. The announcement of his <span title="illation">decision</span> imparted a <span title="lugubrious">mournful</span> phase to the <span title="physiognomies">countenances</span> of his <span title="paternal">fatherly</span> and <span title="maternal">motherly</span>, or rather, - <span title="novercal">stepmotherly</span>, - relations; but <span title="illumed">illuminated</span> <span title="risibilities">smiles</span> upon the <span title="phizes">faces</span> of his enemies.

        <p>When the <span title="doloriferous">painful</span> moment arrived when his <span title="discession">departure</span> was to take its <span title="inception">beginning</span>, his <span title="germans">cousins</span>, <span title="agnations">paternal kinsmen</span> and <span title="cognations">maternal kinsmen</span>, in conjunction with many of his <span title="vicinal">nearby</span> <span title="cotemporaries">contemporary fellows</span>, congregated about him. His parents were <span title="loth">strongly opposed</span> to behold their entire <span title="orbation">bereavement</span>; and the rest, because his migration subjected them to the <span title="amission">loss</span> of an <span title="adjuvant">aiding</span> neighbor.

        <p>The <span title="edicts">decrees</span> of the <span title="Fates">destiny controllers</span> have been quite <span title="propitious">favorable</span> to him since his <span title="ubiety">presence</span> in the <span title="occident">west</span>.

        <p>A very <span title="pecunious">wealthy</span> <span title="consanguineal">blood related</span> <span title="avuncular">uncle</span> relative, - an <span title="agamist">unmarried person</span>, and a <span title="nonagenarian">person between ninety and ninety-nine years old</span>, - having terminated his <span title="subsolar vitality">life beneath the Sun</span>, <span title="bequeathed">willed</span> to Fritz all his <span title="terrestrial">earthly</span> <span title="acquisitions">possessions</span>. He also received his <span title="patrimonial">ancestral</span> <span title="cleronomy">inheritance</span>. The <span title="aggregate">sum total</span>, which was not inconsiderable, enabled him to effect the <span title="emption">purchase</span> of a <span title="hacienda">fine farm</span>.

        <p>The <span title="campestral">field like</span> and <span title="horticultural">garden like</span> enclosures are very <span title="feracious">abundantly producing</span> and <span title="frugiferous">fruitful</span>. The <span title="manse">mansion</span> is <span title="palatial">palace like</span>. The <span title="croft">small farm</span> is <span title="venust">beautiful</span> and attractive.

        <p><span title="Multifarious">Many-parted</span> and <span title="multigenerous">many-kinded</span> <span title="floriferous">flower-bearing</span>, <span title="nuciferous">nut-bearing</span>, <span title="pomiferous">apple-bearing</span>, <span title="pyriferous">pear-bearing</span>, <span title="pruniferous">plum-bearing</span>, and other <span title="fructiferous">fruit-bearing</span> trees and <span title="plantage">plants</span> are not <span title="minus">wanting</span>. Here he can, unannoyed by <span title="bombylious">buzzing</span> puncturing <span title="culices">piercings</span>, and other <span title="sanguivorous">blood-eating</span> <span title="sanguisuges">leeches</span> and <span title="animalculae">small animals</span>, indulge his <span title="ingenerate">inborn</span> <span title="somnolence">sleepiness</span>, and enjoy <span title="superlative">high quality</span> <span title="otiosity">idleness</span>, <span title="autocratorically">self-rulingly</span>.

        <p>The interior <span title="appurtenances">belongings</span> and <span title="garniture">decorations</span> of his <span title="wone">dwelling</span> is <span title="unisonous">in unison</span> with the exterior aspect, and this <span title="educed">drew out</span> from him the <span title="plerophory">full persuasion</span> that he was still under <span title="degarnishment">lack of furnishments</span> whilst <span title="minus">lacking</span> a <span title="femme d'charge">housekeeper</span>, and unassociated with one of the <span title="costal">rib</span> <span title="genus">kind</span>. His <span title="gynephobia">women fearing</span> <span title="minorated">lessened</span> most <span title="perceptibly">clearly</span>, and his <span title="appetition">desire</span> for the <span title="spousal">married</span> state became quite <span title="puissant">powerful</span>. His <span title="erotism">feelings of sexual desire</span> <span title="impelled">drove</span> him to frequent a <span title="nundinal">fair-like</span> occasion, where, <span title="percase">perhaps</span>, he ogled for the first time, at his prospective <span title="cara sposa">spouse</span>. He <span title="espied">spotted</span> her in <span title="consociation">association</span> with a <span title="templar">law student</span>, - a <span title="politicaster">would be politician</span>, - whose <span title="fatuity">stupidity</span> and <span title="parvanimity">little mindedness</span> was visible in all <span title="abearance">behavior</span>.

        <p><span title="A sagittal">An arrow-shaped</span> <span title="puncture">piercing</span> through his <span title="pericardium">heart sac</span> effected such a <span title="clarity">clearness</span> in his <span title="optics">eyes</span>, that he beheld a <span title="millenary">thousand</span> of charms in her <span title="venust">beautiful</span> physique. Her <span title="roseate">rosy</span> <span title="labials">lips</span>; her <span title="liliaceous">lily-like</span> <span title="cuticle">skin</span>; her graceful locomotive organs; and her <span title="mellifluent">flowing with honey</span> and <span title="suaviloquent">sweetly speaking</span> <span title="loquacity">talkativeness</span>, most <span title="parlously">dangerously</span> enamored him, and divested him of all <span title="autarchy">self-sufficiency</span>.

        <p>Having effected <span title="an enterparlance">a mutual conversation</span> with her, he found spontaneity of <span title="interlocution">mutual conversation</span> to be mutual; for the erotic <span title="arcubalister">crossbowman</span> had <span title="actuated">moved to action</span> his <span title="ballister">bent-cross bow</span> and <span title="jaculated">hurled</span> <span title="a sagittary">an arrow-like</span> <span title="vire">arrow having rotary motion</span> into her <span title="cordialities">affections</span> also; but the <span title="eviction">riddance</span> of the <span title="templar">law student</span> from her companionship was the <span title="punctilio">point of exactness</span> of his mental perturbations. The <span title="quodlibet">debatable point</span> induced upon him the most <span title="labefying">weakening</span> <span title="anorexy">loss of appetite</span> and <span title="erotomy">love sickness</span>; but having a <span title="prevision">foresight</span> that the <span title="politicaster's">petty politician's</span> <span title="debonairness">politeness</span> to her was rather impermanent, he brought him into <span title="proximity">contact</span> with a <span title="linguacious">talkative</span>, <span title="psychagogic">attractive</span> <span title="citess">city lady</span>, which effected a <span title="detraction">withdrawing</span> of all his <span title="antecedaneous">former</span> <span title="comity">friendly civility</span> to Miss Amenity. Having thus <span title="segregated">separated</span> the <span title="macaroni">fop</span> from her society, he - making me his <span title="privado">confidant</span>, and enlisting my auxiliary <span title="adjuvancy">assistance</span>, - dispatched to her a <span title="billet d'amour">love letter</span> somewhat after the following diction and <span title="phraseology">manner of expression</span>:-

        <p><span title="Alder-liefest">Most beloved</span> and most <span title="debonair">courteous</span> Miss; -

        <p><span title="Desiderating">Desiring</span> not to be <span title="ambagitory">circuitous</span> in the <span title="prolegomenary">introductory</span> part of this <span title="epistle">letter</span>, and <span title="waiving">omitting</span> all <span title="supervacaneous">unnecessary</span> apologies, I will announce to you that I have <span title="a proclivity">an inclination</span> to assume the <span title="marital">married</span> state, and that, since our recent <span title="tete a tete">face to face</span> <span title="interlocution">conversation</span>, I have <span title="delapsed">fallen</span> into a <span title="dilection">love</span> which has elicited this <span title="amatory">romantic</span> <span title="epistolography">letter</span> to you, and <span title="extorted">forced</span> the conviction that you are the <span title="rara avis">rare person</span> in <span title="consortion">companionship</span> with him the <span title="suavities">sweets</span> and <span title="amaritudes">bitters</span> of my <span title="subastral">beneath the stars</span> <span title="vitality">life</span> might be <span title="felicitously">happily</span> sustained. <span title="Ergo">Therefore</span>, my <span title="prelation">preference</span> of you, and my <span title="optation">great desire</span> to impart to you a <span title="categorical">definite</span> <span title="catenation">chain</span> of the <span title="prerequisites">prior requirements</span>, <span title="assuetudes">customs</span>, and <span title="habilitations">habits</span> of her in whose <span title="sodality">association</span> I am to <span title="protract">extend</span> my <span title="subcelestial">under the heavens</span> career in this <span title="asperous">rough</span> and <span title="subdolous">cunning</span> <span title="megacosm">world</span> to the time of my <span title="obit">death</span>.

        <p>Primarily, her physical structure must be <span title="staminal">of high stamina</span> and <span title="sane">sound</span>. She must not be a <span title="lilliputian">very small person</span>, nor of more than <span title="medial">medium</span> <span title="procerity">height</span>; neither <span title="osseous">bony</span>, nor encumbered with <span title="a superabundance">an excess</span> of <span title="adipous">fatty</span> tissue. Her physique must be <span title="venust">beautiful</span>, and her <span title="physiognomy">face</span> <span title="bonny">comely</span> and <span title="nitid">gleaming</span> as <span title="Phosphor">Venus</span> herself. Her articulations must be <span title="mellifluent">sweetly flowing</span> and <span title="euphonious">nice sounding</span> as those of the <span title="rosignol">nightingale</span>. Her <span title="ambulations">walking</span> must be <span title="perk">quick</span> and <span title="facile">graceful</span>. She must never use <span title="fucus">face paint</span> nor <span title="prink">dress for show</span>. She must <span title="adonize">beautify</span> herself but never envelope herself in <span title="sericeous">downy</span>, or <span title="bombycinous">silken</span> <span title="habiliments">attire</span> and glittering <span title="arraiment">clothes</span>, except on <span title="ecclesiastical">church</span>, <span title="nundinal">fair-related</span>, and <span title="ferial">holiday</span> occasions. She must not be <span title="circumforaneous">going from house to house</span>, nor <span title="multiloquous">talkative</span>; and never become a <span title="quidnunc">person who is curious to know everything going on</span>. Never be <span title="dowdyish">frumpish</span> nor <span title="procacious">bold</span>. She must exhibit <span title="idoneous">appropriate</span> <span title="pudicity">chastity</span> and <span title="obmutescence">silence</span> in the presence of <span title="frens">strangers</span>.

        <p>She must be <span title="au fait">knowledgeable</span> in the <span title="usance">usage</span> of <span title="euphemisms">inoffensive substitution expressions</span>, and never divulge in <span title="hugger muggers">secrets</span>.

        <p>The <span title="evitation">avoidance</span> of <span title="saponaceous">soapy</span> <span title="abstergents">cleansers</span> and other <span title="mundifying">cleansing</span> media to <span title="obviate">avoid</span> <span title="somatic">bodily</span> <span title="fetidness">offensive odor</span>, and a premature <span title="rugose">wrinkled</span> <span title="phiz">face</span>, and apparent <span title="anility">old-womanishness</span>, must never <span title="denote">characterize</span> her. She must possess <span title="interminable">unending</span> <span title="longanimity">good natured tolerance</span>, and never affect any <span title="deliquium">swooning</span> in any <span title="subitaneous">sudden</span> fright. <span title="Fumigation">Smoking</span>, <span title="ructation">belching</span>, and immoderate <span title="yexing">hiccuping</span>, and <span title="oscitancy">yawning</span>, must not be indulged in, in my presence.

        <p>She must be skilled in <span title="domiculture">housekeeping</span>, and in such <span title="hariolation">fortunetelling</span> as <span title="aleuromancy">divination by flowers</span>, <span title="myomancy">divination by mice</span>, <span title="pyromancy">divination by fire</span>, <span title="capnomancy">divination by smoke</span>, and <span title="enoptomancy">divination by mirrors</span>; <span title="dextrous">deft</span> in <span title="panification">the process of making bread</span>, and in the preparation of <span title="polygenous">many-kinded</span> and <span title="polymorphous">many-formed</span> <span title="refections">light meals</span>; <span title="habile">qualified</span> in <span title="malaxation">kneading</span>, and the <span title="facture">making</span> of cakes of <span title="brank">buckwheat</span> and other <span title="cerealia">cereals</span>; <span title="adept">skilled</span> in the confection of <span title="cates">delicacies</span>, <span title="juncates">cheese cakes</span>, <span title="simnels">fine flour cakes</span>, <span title="succades">sweetmeats</span>, and in <span title="verity">truth</span>, <span title="scient">knowing</span> and <span title="perite">skillful</span> in the <span title="facture">making</span> of <span title="omnigenous">many-kinded</span> <span title="comestibles">foods</span> in the <span title="culinary">cooking</span> department. <span title="Eke">Also</span>, she must be well versed as to the chemical constituents of <span title="smegmatic">soapy</span> substances, and exhibit <span title="solertiousness">skillfulness</span> in manufacturing same; and at times operate the <span title="filatory">machine for forming threads</span>.

        <p>To all <span title="murine">mouse-like</span> <span title="quadrupeds">four-legged animals</span>, and all <span title="vermiparous">worm-producing</span>, <span title="pulicose">abounding in fleas</span>, and <span title="culiciform">flea-like</span> <span title="multipeds">multi-legged animals</span>, and <span title="animalculae">minute organisms</span>, and to all <span title="sanguivorous">blood-eating</span> <span title="thoral cimisses">bedbugs</span> about the premises, she must be <span title="ruthlessly">unmercifully</span> <span title="lethiferous">bringing death</span>.

        <p>In finale, she must be <span title="panurgic">skilled in all kinds of work</span> and know that I am <span title="an absolutistic">a totalitarian</span> <span title="acephalist">acknowledger of no superior</span> in my own <span title="domicile">residence</span>. I am favorable to a <span title="synarchy">joint rule</span> or a <span title="diarchy">system with two rulers</span>, but <span title="diametrically">directly</span> <span title="contrariant">opposed</span> and <span title="antagonistic">combating</span> to all <span title="gynecocracy">female ruling</span>.

        <p>I have <span title="a prenotion">foreknowledge</span> that the <span title="antecedent">foregoing</span> enumerated aggregation of physical, ethical, and economical <span title="habilitations">qualifications</span> have a more spacious <span title="depository">roomy lodgment</span> in you than in any other of your gender that has fallen under my vision; and in view of it, I tender to you for your acceptance the <span title="cincture">girdle</span> of <span title="Hymen">the god of marriage</span>.

        <p>In <span title="perclose">conclusion</span>, if you can <span title="reciprocate">make return for</span> the <span title="eupathy">right feeling</span> which <span title="elicited">drew out</span> <span title="amatory">romantic</span> <span title="epistolographical">letter-like</span> <span title="effusion">outpouring</span>, a favorable <span title="replication">reply</span> will most <span title="veritably">truly</span>, invest me with <span title="inenarrable">unable to be narrated</span> <span title="delectation">delight</span>.

        <p>With <span title="metreless">measureless</span> <span title="amity">love</span>,
        Most <span title="erotically">passionately loving</span>, yours,
        Fritz.

        <p>A response, as follows, was <span title="accorded">granted</span>.

        <p>Most <span title="suasory">persuasive</span> Sir:-

        <p>I am the <span title="accipient">receiver</span> of your most <span title="inopinate">unexpected</span> complimentary <span title="erotic">passionately loving</span> <span title="epistle">letter</span>.

        <p><span title="Posterior to">After</span> a careful <span title="lection">reading</span> and <span title="perpension">consideration</span> of its <span title="momental">important</span> <span title="import">significance</span>, which greatly perturbed my <span title="accustomary">usual</span> <span title="somnolence">sleepiness</span>, I know, having my medium <span title="serenitude">tranquility</span>, <span title="alacriously">briskly</span> impart to you a response.

        <p>I am still <span title="celibate">unmarried</span>, though having arrived at the age of <span title="muliebrity">womanhood</span>, and hence, <span title="nubile">suitable for marriage</span> for several <span title="annuary epochs">years</span>. I have had <span title="multitudinous">countless</span> <span title="allectations">enticements</span> to enter into a <span title="maritated">married</span> state, but I have, as yet, <span title="evitated">avoided</span> all <span title="morsure">biting</span> at the <span title="inescations">allurements</span> coming from your gender: and all <span title="illaqueations">traps</span>, and all <span title="illecebrous">alluring</span> <span title="subarrations">betrothal gifts</span> from <span title="ad captandum">crowd pleasing</span> <span title="amorosos">lovers</span>. Whatever might <span title="evene">happen</span>, I have been <span title="procinct">prepared for action</span> against a <span title="procidence">falling down</span> to a state of deterioration by an <span title="infrangible">unable to be violated</span> <span title="consortion">fellowship</span> with <span title="petit-maitres">fellows that dangle about females</span>, or <span title="jackanapes">fops</span> in <span title="fulgid">glittering</span> <span title="ornature">decoration</span>, and <span title="hyperbolical">exaggerated</span>, <span title="pavonian">peacock-like</span> <span title="arraiment">attire</span>. Such could never enter the cycle of my recognized <span title="amorists">lovers</span>.

        <p><span title="Festination">Haste</span> by many of my sex to an <span title="inextricable">inevitable</span> <span title="sponsal">marital</span> <span title="colligation">binding together</span> with such <span title="mangonized">furbished up for sale</span> <span title="quidams">unknown people</span> and <span title="asinegos">stupid fellows</span>, has <span title="crebrously">frequently</span> <span title="obnubilated">clouded</span> the most <span title="lucent">shining</span> <span title="prospicience">foresight</span> of <span title="alger">cheerful</span> <span title="juvenility">youth</span>. Such <span title="eventuations">outcomes</span> made me <span title="meticulous">timid</span>, and by no means, <span title="proclive">prone</span> to <span title="adjugate">yoke</span> my <span title="mundane">earthly</span> <span title="allotment">assignment</span> to any <span title="goman">husband</span>, or animal <span title="implumed">featherless</span> <span title="biped">two legged animal</span>. I came almost to the <span title="illation">conclusion</span> to become a <span title="Malthusian">believer in keeping a growing population in check</span>; at least, to be <span title="solivagant">wandering alone</span> through this <span title="multivious">many roaded</span> <span title="megacosm">world</span> to my ultimate <span title="requietory">resting place</span>.

        <p>Since our <span title="tete a tete">face to face</span> <span title="collocution">speaking together</span> in the <span title="manse">mansion</span> of the <span title="amicable">friendly</span> <span title="aubergist">innkeeper</span>, during <span title="nundinal">fair-like</span> occasion, I have had an <span title="ineffable">indescribable</span> <span title="propendency">propensity</span> for your society. Moreover, your <span title="sapiential">wisdom giving</span> <span title="epistle">letter</span> caused <span title="a bannition">an expulsion</span> of all <span title="equilibration">balancing</span> from my <span title="lacerated">turned up</span> <span title="petto">breast</span>, and <span title="premonstrated">foreshadowed</span> to me that you are, by no means, an <span title="agrammatist">illiterate person</span>, but in <span title="verity">truth</span> a <span title="sapient">wise</span> <span title="belletristical">lovely letter writing</span> <span title="philomath">lover of learning</span>.

        <p>You were not wholly <span title="ignote">unknown</span> to me prior to my primal vision of you at our <span title="adventive">accidental</span> meeting and <span title="confabulation">informal conversation</span>. Your <span title="heliograph">photograph</span> had already fallen under my vision, and caused me to cherish a <span title="preexistimation">previous estimation</span> for you.

        <p>However, in my <span title="cogitations">meditations</span> as to the <span title="prerequisites">prior requirements</span>, and characteristic qualifications of him who may wish to be my marital <span title="comate">companion</span>, I have formulated the following; -

        <p>Primarily, he must be a <span title="franklin, or yeoman">substantial householder</span>, though not <span title="an amnicolist">a near-river dweller</span>. His <span title="agrestical">rural</span> mansion must have <span title="a roboreous">an oaken</span> <span title="contignation">framework</span>, <span title="glabrous">smooth</span> floors, <span title="multitudinous">countless</span> <span title="fenestral apertures">windows</span>, an imposing <span title="exedra">room furnished with seats</span>, or <span title="antesolarium">veranda</span>, various <span title="vestiaries">clothing rooms</span>, and a <span title="balneary">bathing room</span>. It must be well <span title="camerated">arched over</span>, and impervious to the <span title="hyperborean">very cold</span> <span title="frigefactive">freezing</span> <span title="perflations">blows</span> of the <span title="Aquilon">north wind</span>. It must be <span title="environed">surrounded</span> by ample avenues, covered with <span title="scorbiform">sawdust-resembling</span> and <span title="arenaceous">sandy</span> material. A <span title="gelid">cold</span> <span title="puit">spring</span> must not be <span title="minus">lacking</span>.

        <p>The <span title="housal">house</span> <span title="furnishments">furniture</span> must be of medium <span title="preciosity">preciousness</span>. In the <span title="culinary">cooking</span> department, <span title="adeps">lard</span>, <span title="farinaceous">floury</span>, <span title="lactaceous">milky</span>, <span title="ovicular">eggy</span>, and <span title="saccharine">sugary</span> substances for the <span title="facture">making</span> of <span title="omnigenous">many-kinded</span> <span title="doucets">custards</span>, <span title="simnels">fine flour cakes</span>, and <span title="omnifarious">various</span> <span title="pannary">bread-like</span> <span title="comestibles">foods</span>, must not be wanting. <span title="Flabels">Fans</span>, <span title="locofocos, or allumettes">friction matches</span>, and <span title="sebaceous">greasy</span> and kerosene <span title="luciferous">light-bearing</span> <span title="lucerns">lamps</span>, and other nocturnal <span title="illuminators">light givers</span> must be in abundance.

        <p>The <span title="ecuries">stables</span> and the <span title="byres">cow houses</span>, as also their <span title="environs">surroundings</span>, must <span title="exuberate">abound</span> in <span title="montures">mounts</span>, and other <span title="equines">saddle horses</span>; also, <span title="multitudinous">countless</span> <span title="bovine">oxen-like</span>, <span title="vaccine">cow-like</span>, <span title="vituline">calf-like</span>, <span title="lanigerous">wool-bearing</span> <span title="ovine">sheep-like</span>, and <span title="porcine, or suilline">pig-like</span>, <span title="quadrupeds">four-legged animals</span>; all in a state of <span title="rotund">plump</span> <span title="impinguation, or sagination">fattening</span>. <span title="Reciprocornous">Crooked horned</span> <span title="arietating">butting</span> <span title="malodorous">bad smelling</span> <span title="hircines">goats</span> will not be tolerated.

        <p>The <span title="corporeal structure">body</span> of him who is to be my <span title="comate">companion</span>, must not be too <span title="procere">tall</span>; - at least, he must be a <span title="brobdingnagian">giant</span>, - and by no means, must he be a <span title="homunculus">dwarf</span>. Not too <span title="rotund">plump</span> nor too angular. He must be <span title="equicrural">equal legged</span>, and not <span title="macropodous">big footed</span> or <span title="claudicant">limp</span>; not <span title="macrognathic">long-jawed</span> or <span title="macrotous">large-eared</span>; and somewhat <span title="macrencephalous">large brained</span>. In <span title="verity">truth</span>, his physique must be <span title="adonean">fair</span>.

        <p>He must be very <span title="deft">skilled</span> in his <span title="arraiment">clothing</span>, and keep his <span title="labials">lips</span> <span title="mundified">cleansed</span> from all <span title="nicotian">tobacco</span> <span title="succulence">juice</span>; - in <span title="verity">truth</span>, <span title="sedulously">diligently</span> <span title="evitate">avoid</span>, at all times, the <span title="manducation">chewing</span>, <span title="ebullition">smoking</span>, and <span title="nasal inhalation">breathing in through the nose</span> of the <span title="noxious">harmful</span> <span title="plantage">plant</span>. He must not be <span title="an oenophilist">a lover of wine</span>, but a very <span title="abstemious">self-disciplined</span> <span title="nephalist">abstainer from spirituous liquor</span>. He must <span title="evitate">avoid</span> <span title="disassiduity">want of care</span> as to the <span title="mundification">cleansing</span> of his <span title="dental organs">teeth</span>, and <span title="cutaneous">skin</span> surface. He must never be <span title="desidious">lazy</span> in <span title="pediluvy">feet bathing</span>, <span title="balneation">bathing</span>, and <span title="salination">washing with salt water</span>, for the <span title="remotion">removal</span> of <span title="hogo">strong scent</span>, occasioned by <span title="exsudations">sweating</span>, and <span title="dermal">skin</span> <span title="desquamations">shedding</span>. During a <span title="procellous">stormy</span> and <span title="lutarious">muddy</span> season, he must <span title="sedulously">diligently</span> <span title="absterge">cleanse</span> all <span title="illutation">mud coatings</span> from his <span title="pedial extremities">feet</span>, prior to making his <span title="introgression">entry</span> to the house.

        <p><span title="Sputation">Spitting</span> on the <span title="tapis">tapestry</span> will not be tolerated, and the nonessential <span title="augean">exceedingly filthy</span> <span title="cuspidor">receptacle for spit</span> must be - <span title="non est">not present</span>.

        <p>All <span title="mussitation">muttering</span> relative to the <span title="elixation">digestion</span> and preparation of <span title="cibarious">edible</span> articles of <span title="alimentation">nourishment</span>, are <span title="peremptorily">absolutely</span> <span title="tabooed">forbidden</span>.

        <p>In company, he must be <span title="bonair">courteous</span> and <span title="homiletic">affable</span>; and never <span title="querulential">quarrelsome</span>, or of too <span title="potestative">authoritative</span> <span title="portance">carriage</span>. In his <span title="collocution">conversation</span>, he must be a <span title="quodlibetarian">person who discusses any subject at pleasure</span>, but not a <span title="monologist">conversation monopolizer</span>; and by no means, <span title="pompatic">pompous</span>, <span title="umbratious">disposed to take offense</span>, <span title="temerarious">headstrong</span>, <span title="clerkless">unlearned</span>, or <span title="incony">artless</span>; devoid of all <span title="incivism">lack of patriotism</span>, <span title="inertitude">laziness</span>, <span title="perfunctoriness">carelessness</span>, and <span title="ingannation">deception</span>. He must not be a <span title="punctilious">meticulous</span> <span title="precisianist">restraining person</span>; never too <span title="captious">fault finding</span>, and <span title="scoptically">jeeringly</span> <span title="nasute">critically nice</span>; never guilty of <span title="macrology">tedious talk without much substance</span>, <span title="psilology">the love of empty talk</span>, <span title="balbucination">stammering</span>, or <span title="heterophemy">the unconscious saying of what is not intended to be said</span>.

        <p>By no means, must he be <span title="stertorous">deeply snoring</span> in his <span title="obdormition">sleep</span>, or be subject to <span title="somniloquism">talking in sleep</span> and <span title="somnambulism">walking in sleep</span>. In his <span title="operosity">laboriousness</span> in this <span title="subcelestial">under the heavens</span> <span title="arena">sphere of action</span>, he must not be a <span title="mammonite">worshiper of money</span>, or be given to <span title="cosmolatry">worshiping the world</span>. He must be very <span title="homiletical">talkative</span> and altruistic towards <span title="eleemosynaries">people who subsist on charity</span>, inmates of <span title="orphanotrophies">hospitals for orphans</span>, <span title="sportularies">those living on alms</span>, and those in a state of <span title="obolary">impoverished</span> <span title="viduity">widowhood</span>.

        <p><span title="Adunation">Union</span> with any of the <span title="existential">existing</span> <span title="cryptic">secret</span> <span title="germanities">societies</span>, or guilds, and all <span title="noctivagations">wanderings in the night</span>, and <span title="omnivagations">wanderings all over the place</span>, subjecting me to <span title="solitariety">solitariness</span>, and <span title="solicitous">concerned</span> <span title="excubations">vigils</span>, must never characterize him.

        <p>Indiscriminate <span title="fidejussion">being bound as surety for another</span> must never have <span title="immanency">indwelling</span> in his <span title="harns">brain</span>. <span title="An abjurement">A renunciation</span> of all <span title="miscreance">adherence to a false religion</span> and <span title="demonocracy">ruling by demons</span> and <span title="demonolatry">worship by demons</span>; and a <span title="cordial">sincere</span> <span title="acceptation">acceptance</span> of Christianity, must ever <span title="denote">characterize</span> him.

        <p>He must be <span title="lusory">playful</span> with the <span title="bairns">children</span>, and <span title="paradigmatic">exemplary</span> to them; and <span title="indulge">humor</span> them freely in their <span title="anthropomorphized">people-mimicking</span> feats of <span title="equestrianism">horsemanship</span> and <span title="sciomachy">shadow fighting</span>, and in their <span title="barmecidal">unreal</span> <span title="sybaritic">luxurious</span> feasts; and <span title="erudiate">educate</span> and indoctrinate them to be <span title="veridical">truthful</span>, without <span title="baculine">rod punishing</span> <span title="vapulation">beating</span>, or <span title="fustigation">cudgeling</span>.

        <p>The <span title="sponsal">marital</span> <span title="munities">securities</span> I claim for myself, are:- To be <span title="autocratrix">female sovereign</span> in all departments of the <span title="domicile">residence</span>, and assume full <span title="solidarity">union of interests</span> -<span title="alibi">elsewhere</span>, -<span title="algates">everywhere</span>. Consent for <span title="protracted">drawn out</span> <span title="evagations">excursions</span>, and <span title="obequitations">ridings about</span>, when <span title="desiderated">desired</span>, must be <span title="alacriously">lively</span> granted. All <span title="seminations">seed sowing</span>, <span title="aberuncations">weeding outs</span>, and <span title="sarculations">weedings</span> in the <span title="hortulan">garden-belonging</span> <span title="sepiment">separating hedge</span>; the <span title="pabulation">feeding</span> of <span title="vaccine">cow-like</span>, <span title="equine">horse-like</span>, and <span title="curvicaudate">curly tailed</span> <span title="porcine">pig-like</span> <span title="quadrupeds">four legged animals</span>; and the <span title="ablactation">weaning</span> of the <span title="mugient">bellowing</span> <span title="vituline">calf-like</span> <span title="quadrupeds">four legged animals</span>; and in <span title="verity">truth</span>, all <span title="latreutical">servile</span> work about the <span title="equerry">large stable for horses</span>, the <span title="vaccary">cow house</span> and the <span title="lactary">dairyhouse</span>, is most explicitly <span title="recused">rejected</span>.

        <p>In case the <span title="omega">death</span> of my <span title="sponsal">marital</span> partner should <span title="antedate">precede</span> mine, <span title="impignoration">pledging</span> not to enjoy <span title="digamy, or deuterogamy">the state of being married twice</span>, will not be given in my <span title="desponsation">betrothal</span> to any <span title="adamite">descendant of Adam</span>, or masculine <span title="biped">two legged animal</span> of <span title="the genus homo">humankind</span>. Should a <span title="catalysis">dissolution</span> of the <span title="sponsal">marital</span> affiliation even, - and that by <span title="diffarreation">divorce</span>, on account of <span title="inebriety">drunkenness</span>, or any other <span title="malefaction">evil doing</span>, then, a <span title="dimidiation">division into two parts</span> of the <span title="acquisitions">property</span> would have to occur.

        <p>Finally, should my <span title="mari">husband</span> and I enjoy <span title="consenescence">growing old together</span>, and be nearly <span title="commorient">dying together at the same time</span>, and my <span title="obital period">death</span> <span title="antevene">come before</span> his, then my <span title="desideration">desire</span> is, to be <span title="funerated">buried with funeral rites</span> <span title="debonairly">gently and nicely</span> in a <span title="feateous">neat</span> <span title="requietory">resting place</span>. Such are the <span title="munities">securities</span> I reserve for myself, and to which I <span title="surmise">suspect</span> you will readily yield <span title="assentment">agreement</span>. Your <span title="supravulgar">beyond common people</span> <span title="cogitations">thoughts</span>, as well as your position beyond the <span title="purlieus">outskirts</span> of <span title="plebeiance">vulgarity</span> must <span title="lucidly">clearly</span> <span title="premonstrate">represent beforehand</span> it.

        <p>On condition of compliance with the above <span title="requisitions">requirements</span>, I accept your <span title="proffered">offered</span> <span title="cincture">girdle</span> of <span title="Hymen">the god of marriage</span>, with the <span title="esperance">hope</span> that our <span title="connubial">marital</span> <span title="adunation">union</span> and consequent <span title="solidarity">union of interests</span> and interdependency may cause an <span title="amelioration">improvement</span> of the <span title="asperities">difficulties</span> incident to our <span title="terrestrial">earthly</span> <span title="vitality">life</span>, and aid us in the <span title="devitation">avoiding</span> of many of the <span title="tentations">temptations</span> in this <span title="immund">unclean</span> and <span title="inquinated">polluted</span> <span title="mundane structure">world</span>; and I leave it to your <span title="arbitrament">decision</span> to designate the day of <span title="bridality">celebration of the nuptial feast</span>. <span title="Perchance">By chance</span> the <span title="proximate">next</span> <span title="plenilune">full moon</span> would be the most <span title="idoneous">fitting</span> period for the <span title="hymeneal">marital</span> <span title="conjugation">union</span>; and may the <span title="supermundane">heavenly</span> powers invest the <span title="paranymphal">bridal</span> occasion with their <span title="auspicious">favorable</span> <span title="benison">blessing</span>.
        In <span title="an aureate">a golden</span> <span title="ligature">binding</span>,
        Your <span title="eviternal">everlasting</span> <span title="affianced">pledged to be married</span>,
        E.M. Amenity.

        <p>Fritz has given me <span title="assecuration">assurance</span> that the said <span title="paranymphal">bridal</span> occasion will occur as suggested, and not on the <span title="Greek calends">time that will never come</span>. However, as to the culmination and final sequel, - more <span title="anon">in a little while</span>.

        <p>I will now bring to a <span title="finis">conclusion</span> this <span title="sesquipedalian">long worded</span> <span title="cacographical">badly written</span> scrawl, with the assurance that
        I am,
        Yours, <span title="pedantically">school master like</span>,

        <h1>Letter VII,</h1>
        <h2><span title="Megalopolis">Main City</span> of the <span title="Occident">West</span></h2>
        <h3>July 4, 1873</h3>

        <p>Most <span title="paraphrastical">rewording to clarify</span> Sir:-

        <p>In my <span title="predecessive">preceding</span> <span title="lexiphanic">bombastic</span> communication, I gave you a <span title="compendious">concise</span> biographical sketch of Fritz, and his <span title="amatorial">lovemaking</span> experience. I now, <span title="rathe">early in the morning</span> on this, our national <span title="ferial">holiday</span> occasion, again bring into <span title="requisition">demand</span>, my <span title="scaturient">overflowing</span> pen, and <span title="plethoric">excessive</span> <span title="cornucopia">abundance</span> of <span title="arcane">old</span> <span title="sesquipedalities">long words</span>, and <span title="essay">try</span> to <span title="excogitate">think out</span> yet another <span title="euphuistic">ornate</span>, <span title="cabalistical">mystical</span> <span title="epistolary">letter</span> <span title="effusion">outpouring</span>; but, being at present, otherwise somewhat pragmatically engaged, I shall be, necessarily, more <span title="laconic">brief</span>.

        <p>On a certain <span title="dominical day">Sunday</span>, recently, I repaired to a <span title="locality">place</span> where <span title="audition">listening</span> was given to a certain <span title="ecclesiastic">minister</span>. The <span title="conflux">crowd</span> was <span title="ample">large</span>.

        <p>The <span title="precentor, or accentor">choir director</span> of the <span title="quiristers">choir singers</span>, <span title="inchoated">began</span> the initial sonata with too much altitude of <span title="intonation">musical tone</span>, which produced considerable <span title="raucity">hoarseness</span> in his <span title="guttural">throaty</span> <span title="orifice">opening</span> before its <span title="termination">ending</span>; especially during the <span title="antiphon">choir's chant response</span>.

        <p><span title="Subsequent to">Following</span> this <span title="cantation">singing</span>, there was a general <span title="taciturnity">silence</span>. He was <span title="auricomous">golden-haired</span> and his <span title="countenance">face</span> was <span title="saturnine">gloomy</span>. His <span title="aspect">appearance</span> was <span title="juvenile">youthful</span>; his <span title="corporeal">bodily</span> structure was <span title="gracile">slender</span>; his <span title="nasal protrusion, or olfactor">nose</span> <span title="possessed">had</span> <span title="singular">exceptional</span> <span title="tenuity">thinness</span>, and <span title="cacuminated">came to a point</span> <span title="astoundingly">surprisingly</span>. His theme was <span title="esperance">hope</span>. In his <span title="exordium">introductory oration</span>, or <span title="catastasis">outline of subjects to be discussed</span>, he was somewhat tranquil, but not <span title="didascalic">educational</span>. In a <span title="brevity">briefness</span> of time, however, he became <span title="stentorophonic">loud</span> and <span title="spumous">bubbling</span> in his <span title="oral aperture">mouth</span>. His <span title="sputations">spittings</span> became frequent, and his <span title="palpebral">eyelid</span> and <span title="ciliary">eyelash</span> organs gained indescribable <span title="celerity">speed</span>. <span title="Obstupefaction">Stupefying</span> seized his <span title="sectators">disciples</span> in view of his supposed <span title="polymathy">varied learnedness</span>; but his <span title="hermeneutical">explanatory</span> <span title="eclaircissement">clarification</span> of his subject was <span title="cryptic">encoded</span>, <span title="acataleptic">impossibly arrived at</span>, and <span title="hypothetical">speculative</span>, as well as <span title="problematical">problematic</span> and <span title="amphibological">ambiguous in grammatical construction</span>.

        <p>His <span title="ambilogy">language of doubtful meaning</span>, <span title="altiloquence">lofty speech</span>, and <span title="largiloquence">boastful speech</span>, <span title="exsuscitated">excited</span> my <span title="irrision">derisive laughter</span>. The <span title="eristical">disputational</span> part of his <span title="homily">sermon</span> was <span title="fraught with">full of</span> <span title="alogies">absurdities</span> and <span title="paralogies">false reasonings</span>, and furnished an <span title="indubitable">unquestionable</span> <span title="apodixis">support of a proposition by reference to common knowledge</span> of his <span title="insipience">stupidity</span> in honorable <span title="polemics">refutations of doctrine</span>, and <span title="homiletics">the art of rhetorical theology</span>. Towards <span title="dissentients">differers in belief</span>, he <span title="evinced">showed</span> such discourtesy and <span title="displacency">dislike</span> as <span title="exacerbated">irritated</span> my interior nature.

        <p>When his course was <span title="zetetic">questioning</span>, he propounded the most <span title="amphigorical">nonsensically poetic</span> and <span title="extraneous">irrelevant</span> interrogations; and his <span title="responsions">responses</span> <span title="thereto">to that</span> were <span title="chimerical">fancifully imaginative</span>, <span title="catachrestical">using the wrong words in context</span>, and totally irrelevant. In his <span title="vociferations">loud complaints</span>, there was occasionally a <span title="subitaneous">sudden</span> <span title="dysphony">difficulty of speaking</span>; <span title="seldom">rare</span> <span title="euphony">agreeable sounds</span>, but the most <span title="cruciating">painful</span> <span title="cacophony">bad sounds</span>. As to his <span title="supernal">celestial</span> <span title="entheasm">inspiration</span>, he labored under <span title="a Muggletonian">an imaginary</span> hallucination altogether.

        <p>His <span title="sermocination">sermon</span> had already <span title="transcended">surpassed</span> <span title="compendiosity">briefness</span>, and yet, he <span title="appended">added</span> a <span title="platitudinous">corny</span> <span title="peroration">conclusion</span>, in which he primarily <span title="inveighed">bitterly complained</span> against <span title="pyrrhonism">radical skepticism</span> that is becoming so <span title="temerarious">presumptuously daring</span> in this age; and after frowning it down by the <span title="torvity">sour-facedness</span> of <span title="visage">face</span>, he entered upon an <span title="inconcinnous">unsuitable</span>, and very <span title="aristarchian">severely critical</span>  <span title="allocution">exhorting speech</span> to his <span title="sectators">disciples</span>, in which he <span title="exprobrated">reproached</span> their <span title="attrition">sorrow for sin only for fear of damnation</span> and their want of <span title="contrition">true repentance</span>, and <span title="genuflection">bowing</span> in their <span title="obtestations">earnest beggings</span>; and <span title="trenchantly">keenly</span>, in very <span title="comminatory">warning of punishment</span> terms, <span title="vituperated">reprimanded</span> their <span title="stultiloquence">silly talking</span>, <span title="adiaphorism">religious indifference</span>, and their mutual <span title="obtrectations">slanders</span>; and by <span title="protracted">drawn out</span> <span title="tautophonies">repetitions of sound</span> insisted on an <span title="auxesis">increase</span> of their <span title="foy">faith</span>, and <span title="an expurgation">a literary deletion of objectionable parts</span> of their <span title="nefarious">extremely wicked</span> <span title="piacularities">criminalities</span> and <span title="nefandous">atrociously sinful</span> abominations; by <span title="indesinent">ceaseless</span> <span title="invocation">divine summoning</span>. He <span title="depainted">outlined</span> their <span title="multiform">many formed</span> <span title="tentations">temptations</span>, and gave them a <span title="calid">fervent</span> <span title="hortation">exhortation</span> to the <span title="exercitation">exercise</span> of <span title="esperance">hope</span> during the allotment of their <span title="sublunary">worldly and non-spiritual</span> <span title="vitality">life</span>. The <span title="vaticinated">prophesized</span> that then, in their entrance to the <span title="supernal">celestial</span> world, they should be <span title="inenarrably">indescribably</span> <span title="felicitous">happy</span>.

        <p>In his finale, he insisted on a <span title="collatitious">brought together by contributions</span> operation throughout the <span title="assemblage">assembly</span>, for <span title="redemption">saving from sin</span> of <span title="theomachists">fighters of god</span>, and the <span title="ethnics">Heathens</span> to the <span title="fruition">enjoyment</span> of ethical and theological <span title="cognoscence">awareness</span>; and after the <span title="eduction">drawing out</span> of <span title="pelf">dishonestly acquired money</span> from our <span title="nummary">money</span> receptacles, he prepared us, in a <span title="benedictory">thanks giving</span> <span title="orison">prayer</span>, for <span title="regression">return</span> to our <span title="domiciliary tenements">homes</span>.

        <p>On the succeeding <span title="matin">morning</span>, I set out for this metropolitan <span title="emporium">store</span>, or <span title="megalopolis">very large city</span> of the <span title="hesperian">western</span> plateaus, where I now temporarily <span title="abide">stay</span>.

        <p>The <span title="matutine">early morning</span> part of that day was characterized by all phases that possess <span title="puissance">power</span> to impart <span title="satiety">fullness</span> to the visual, <span title="auricular">hearing</span>, and <span title="olfactory">smelling</span> powers of our complex constitution.

        <p>The <span title="reorient">rising again</span> <span title="exortive">east-rising</span> <span title="solar luminary">Sun</span>, in his <span title="emanation">radiation</span>, or <span title="exurgence">coming to light</span>, from the <span title="oriental">eastern</span> <span title="margaric">pearly</span> portals, cast <span title="luculent">brightly shining</span> <span title="rayonnant">darting forth</span> <span title="coruscations">flashes of brilliance</span> into the <span title="innubilous">cloudless</span> <span title="azure">sky-blue</span> concavity; and his <span title="efflugent">brilliant</span> <span title="candent">glowing</span> <span title="ascension">rising</span> <span title="coerced">forced</span> the <span title="subterrene">underground</span> <span title="seminal">seed-like</span> and <span title="radical">root-like</span> deposits to <span title="pullulate">germinate</span> and <span title="diffuse">scatter</span> <span title="vernal">spring</span> <span title="viridity">greenness</span> over nature's <span title="undulating">wavy</span> surface. The <span title="sylvan">wood</span> regions, or rather, <span title="nemorous">full of trees</span> and <span title="arbuscular">arbuscle-full</span> <span title="riparian">river bank</span> <span title="boscages">thickets</span>, were <span title="replete with">full of</span> the most <span title="mellifluent">sweet-sounding</span> <span title="canorous">melodious</span> <span title="cantations">songs</span> of the <span title="pennated">feathered</span> <span title="tenants">inhabitants</span> of the <span title="aerial">airy</span> regions. The <span title="herbaceous">herby</span>, <span title="graminaceous">grassy</span>, and <span title="floriferous">flower-bearing</span> <span title="foliage">plants</span> having been <span title="humectated">moistened</span>, and made <span title="rorifluent">flowing with dew</span> by <span title="nocturnal">nightly</span> <span title="irrorations">sprinklings with wet dew</span>, emitted the most grateful <span title="ambrosial">fragrant</span> <span title="redolence">sweet scent</span>.

        <p>My functions are now <span title="emporetical">mercantile</span>, <span title="amaneunsical">shorthand typing</span>, and <span title="brachygraphical">shorthand writing</span>. I am quite <span title="negotiously">busily</span> engaged, and somewhat a <span title="lychnobite">laborer of the night</span>.

        <p>As a <span title="nolleity">state of unwillingness</span> to <span title="abide">stay</span> here coerces me, and moreover since - <span title="remudas de pasturage haze bizerros gordos">change of pasture makes fat calves</span>, - I shall perhaps, during the <span title="autumnal">autumn</span> season, resume my <span title="multivagous">frequent wandering</span> and <span title="mundivagant">world wandering</span> <span title="pererrations">wanderings</span>; which may <span title="eventuate">chance to happen</span> in my <span title="transfretations">passing over</span> of the Pacific ocean, and <span title="circumnavagation">travelling around</span> of this <span title="terrene">land</span>.

        <p>Till which time,
        I shall remain,
        Your <span title="conterraneous">same country dwelling</span> <span title="cotemporary">person living at the same time</span>,

        <h3>November 4, 1872</h3>

        <p>Most <span title="Juvenile">Sophomorical</span> Sir:-

        <p>Your <span title="Greek-like and Latin-like">Graeco-Latin</span> <span title="little letter">epistolet</span> or <span title="mystical">cabalistical</span> <span title="nonsense">abracadabra</span>, lies before me <span title="decoded">deciphered</span> and <span title="clarified">eclaircised</span> to the best of my linguistic, <span title="universally understandable writing">pasigraphical</span>, and <span title="critically explanatory">exegetical</span> abilities. As a <span title="well deserved">merited</span> <span title="verbal reprimand">castigation</span> <span title="for that">therefor</span>, and to test your <span title="accustomed">wonted</span> <span title="good-natured tolerance">longanimity</span>, I shall <span title="vigorously oppose">recalcitrate</span> by <span title="pouring out">effunding</span> upon you, in <span title="letter-like">epistolic</span> form, my <span title="overflowing">scaturient</span> <span title="abundance">cornucopia</span> of <span title="pretentious">lexiphanic</span> <span title="long words">sesquipedalities</span>, <span title="Johnson-era">Johsonian</span> <span title="old words">archaisms</span>, <span title="foreign words">exoticisms</span>, <span title="invented words">neologianisms</span>, <span title="local and provincial words">pativinities</span>, <span title="and all of that kind">et id genus omne</span>.

        <p>In former <span title="letter-like">epistolary</span> <span title="scribbles">scribblements</span>, I gave you the <span title="string">concatenation</span> of <span title="accompanying">concomitant</span> circumstances <span title="motion-starting">initiatory</span> to my <span title="migration">transmigration</span> to this remote section of the <span title="western">occidental</span> portions of our columbian republican <span title="union">coadunation</span>. I have also <span title="precisely outlined">delineated</span> my <span title="dangerous">periculous</span> adventures among the <span title="painted">fucated</span>, <span title="red-faced">rubicund</span> <span title="original inhabitants">autochthons</span>, or aborigines; portrayed various incidents of <span title="huntings">venations</span> in which I participated, <span title="reducing">minorating</span> <span title="flocked">gregal</span> <span title="gatherings">aggregations</span> of bison and <span title="prong-horned animals">antilocapridae</span> which abound on the <span title="grassy">gramineous</span>, <span title="western">occiduous</span> plateaus; depicted my primal vision of the <span title="deceiving">illusive</span> <span title="extraordinary">phenomenal</span> mirage, and the fata morgana; and in <span title="truth">verity</span>, recounted much of my <span title="fluctuating in fortune">vicissitudinous</span> experience whilst with the caravan traversing the <span title="western">occidental</span> <span title="extensive tracts of level and open land">champaigns</span>.

        <p>I am, however, not <span title="unaware">oblivious</span> of the fact, that when we imparted mutual <span title="departing">valedictory</span> <span title="goodbyes">conges</span>, I laid myself under obligations to give you <span title="an all-encompassing">a pantographical</span> <span title="precise outline">delineation</span> of the <span title="western">ponent</span> regions upon which I might cast my <span title="eyes">ophthalmic organs</span>. As it would be a <span title="clear">dilucid</span> <span title="wandering">evagation</span> from my <span title="usual">accustomary</span> <span title="mechanical regularity">routinism</span> to <span title="delay">comperendinate</span> the fulfillment of my <span title="promises">pollicitations</span> by procrastination or <span title="abandonment">dereliction</span>, I shall, deeming this a <span title="sufficient thing">suffisance</span>, <span title="prefacing">proemially</span>, or <span title="preliminarily">prolegominarily</span>, <span title="attempt">essay</span> to further <span title="disburden">exonerate</span> myself of said obligations, and <span title="in the first place">imprimis</span> give you a <span title="geographically descriptive">chorographical</span> sketch of this part of our <span title="western">hesperian</span> domain, and a <span title="comprehensive and concise">compendiarious</span> <span title="ordered listing">enumeration</span> of its <span title="native">autochthonal</span> <span title="plants">flora</span> and <span title="animals">fauna</span>.

        <p>The <span title="surface features">superficies</span> of the <span title="western">occidental</span> portion are <span title="made diverse">diversified</span> by many <span title="lofty">altitudinarian</span>, <span title="earthly">terrene</span>, <span title="stony">lapidarious</span>, and <span title="rocky">rupellary</span> <span title="thunder-smitten">acroceraunian</span> <span title="mountains">montanic elevations</span>. Some of <span title="gigantic">cyclopean</span> <span title="immensity">vastidity</span>, and <span title="perfect">sublime</span> <span title="roughness">scabredity</span>. Their <span title="wonderful">mirificent</span> <span title="icy">glacious</span> <span title="peaks">pinnacles</span> tower, apparently above the <span title="cloudy">nubiferous</span> regions, into the <span title="dark">caliginous</span> <span title="highest heavens">empyrean</span>.

        <p>The <span title="eastern">oriental</span> portion is a vast <span title="wavy">undulating</span> plateau; extremely <span title="long">longitudinal</span> and <span title="wide">latitudinous</span>; having few <span title="meager">exiguous</span> <span title="valleys">dingles</span>. Its <span title="earthy">terreous</span> surface is covered with a most nutritious <span title="native">autochthonous</span> <span title="dry-weather-thriving">xerophilous</span> <span title="grassy">graminaceous</span> growth; principally, bouteloua oligostachya, tripsacum dactyloides, mesquite, and gramma. This growth sustains <span title="horse">equine</span>, <span title="cow">bovine</span>, <span title="goat">hircine</span>, and <span title="sheep">ovine</span> <span title="four-legged animals">quadrupeds</span> in a state of <span title="plump">rotund</span> <span title="fattening">impinguation</span> during the entire <span title="wintry">hiemal</span> season. Artemisia tridentata, the <span title="sun-following">solisequious</span> <span title="sunflowers">helianthus</span>, <span title="prickled">aculeated</span> cactus opuntia, and <span title="diverse">multifarious</span> <span title="fleshy-leaved">succulent</span> <span title="prickle-bearing">acanthaceous</span> and <span title="needle-bearing">aciculated</span> <span title="cactus-like">cactaceous</span> <span title="herbs">plantage</span>, and <span title="flower-bearing">floriferous</span>, <span title="herb-like">herbaceous</span>, and <span title="grass-like-leaved">graminifolious</span> <span title="decorations">garniture</span> <span title="enjoy luxury">luxuriate</span> in many <span title="areas and neighbourhoods">localities</span>.

        <p>The <span title="river">fluvial</span> <span title="winding courses">meanders</span> are limited, and originate from the <span title="liquifying">liquefaction</span> of vast <span title="snowy">niveous</span> and <span title="icy">glacial</span> accumulations in the <span title="mountainous">montanic</span> regions. None are <span title="ship-bearing">navigerous</span>, but they are <span title="full of trout">truttaceous</span> and <span title="duck-bearing">anatiferous</span>. Some are <span title="golden">pactolian</span>, and all extremely <span title="glittering">relucent</span>, and possess a great degree of <span title="transparency">diaphaneity</span>. None tardy in <span title="onward flow">profluence</span>. At many points, their <span title="coasts">rivages</span>, especially in the <span title="neighbourhood">vicinity</span> of <span title="river mouths">embouchures</span>, or <span title="dischargings">disemboguements</span> of <span title="watercourses">arroyos</span>, are <span title="full">replete</span> with a <span title="mixture">promiscuity</span> of <span title="rough-leaved">asperifolious</span>, <span title="berry-bearing">bacciferous, or cocciferous</span>, <span title="vine-like">vinaceous</span>, <span title="reed-like">arundinaceous</span>, and other <span title="clusters of bushes">bushments</span>.

        <p><span title="Masses">Myriads</span> of <span title="poisonous">venene</span>, <span title="umbel-bearing">umbelliferous</span>, <span title="corymb-bearing">corymbiferous</span>, <span title="raceme-bearing">racemiferous</span>, <span title="nettle-bearing">urticaceous</span>, <span title="fruit-bearing">fructiferous</span>, <span title="flower-bearing">anthophorous, or floriferous</span> <span title="plants">plantage</span>, and <span title="varied">multifarious</span> <span title="uncultivated">spontaneous</span> <span title="edible">esculent</span> products also abound. The <span title="native">autochthonous</span> <span title="woody">arboreous</span> growth consists of <span title="needled">acerose</span> <span title="evergreen">sempervirent</span> and <span title="deciduous">perdifolious</span> <span title="forests">silva</span>, and <span title="groves">boscages</span>. By no means, of <span title="huge">immane</span> <span title="steepness">arduity</span>, or totally <span title="without">devoid of</span> <span title="crooks">aduncities</span>, <span title="knots">nodosities</span>, and <span title="pointed rocks">knags</span>. <span title="Deforestation">Disboscation</span> by <span title="cutting down trees">succision</span> and <span title="large fires">conflagrations</span> will deplete same in the next decade.

        <p>The <span title="creeping">reptatory</span>, <span title="feathered">pennigerous</span>, <span title="cloven-hoofed">bisulcous</span> and <span title="clawed">unguiculated</span> <span title="wild">feral</span> <span title="beings">entities</span> of this domain are; <span title="blackbirds">ousels</span>, <span title="partridges">ptarmigans</span>, <span title="small birds">ortolans</span>, <span title="larks">leverocks</span>, <span title="humming birds">trochidae</span>, <span title="wild ducks">shelducks</span>, <span title="herons">cryals</span>, <span title="venomous serpents">kokobs</span>, <span title="creeping reptiles">creeples</span>, <span title="diamond rattlesnakes">crotaluses</span>, <span title="wolverines">carcajous</span>, <span title="hares">logomyes</span>, <span title="beavers">castors</span>, <span title="woodchucks">marmots</span>, <span title="bad smelling">malodorous</span> <span title="polecats">mariputs</span>, <span title="skunks">"spilogale putorius"</span>, <span title="hares">"lepus campestris"</span>, <span title="mountain sheep">"oves montanoe"</span>, <span title="antelope">"antilocapridae"</span>, bison, <span title="ground squirrels">spermophiles</span>, coyotes, <span title="grizzly bears">grizzlies-ursus horribilis</span>, and other animals of the <span title="mouse">murine</span>, <span title="squirrel">sciurine</span>, <span title="cat">feline</span>, <span title="dog">canine</span>, <span title="rabbit">leporine</span>, <span title="fox">vulpine</span>, <span title="wolf">lupine</span>, <span title="bear">ursine</span>, <span title="deer">cervine</span>, <span title="goat">caprine</span>, <span title="sheep">ovine</span>, and <span title="horse">equine</span> genera. Also, <span title="strong-winged">pennipotent</span> <span title="hawk-like">accipitrine</span> and <span title="eagle-like">aquiline</span> <span title="birds of prey">raptors</span>. There are apparently <span title="unending">interminable</span> areas almost wholly <span title="dominated">monopolized</span> by <span title="prairie dogs">cynomys ludovicianus</span>. Viewing the <span title="laughable">ludicrous</span> antics of these <span title="playful">lusory</span> <span title="squirrel-like">sciurine</span> burrowing rodents, in their <span title="running abouts">circumcursations</span>, or perched, <span title="like a man">a la homo</span> upon the <span title="peaks">apices</span> of their <span title="cone-shaped">coniform</span> <span title="mounds">tumulosities</span> <span title="ceaselessly">incessitously</span> <span title="barking">allatrating</span>, one cannot control his <span title="laughter muscles">risibles</span>.

        <p>The <span title="between-mountain">intermontane</span> sections of this region are as <span title="gold-bearing">auriferous</span> and <span title="silver-bearing">argentiferous</span> as any of the <span title="southern">austral</span>, remote <span title="south-western">austrine occidental</span>, or extreme <span title="western">occidental</span> and <span title="northern">septentrional</span> sections of this republican <span title="union">adunation</span>. They are also <span title="iron-bearing">ferriferous</span>, <span title="carbon-bearing">carboniferous</span>, or <span title="anthracite-bearing">anthraciferous</span>, <span title="lead-bearing">plumbiferous</span>, and <span title="copper-bearing">cupriferous</span>.

        <p>The <span title="fruitfulness">uberty or fecundity</span> of the soil in the <span title="fertile">battable</span> sections, when properly <span title="manured">stercorated</span> and <span title="watered">irrigated</span>, <span title="excels">exuperates</span> <span title="exposition">enarration</span>. Besides <span title="wheaty and grainy">frumentarious</span> products - which yield a most <span title="fine wheat">siliginose</span> flour - there are produced in <span title="open field">campestrian</span> and <span title="kitchen garden">olitory</span> enclosures; <span title="buckwheat">brank</span>, <span title="pumpkins">citruls</span>, <span title="sarment-bearing">sarmentaceous</span> <span title="strawberries">fragaria</span>, <span title="cucumber-like">cucurbitaceous</span>, <span title="salad-like">acetarious</span>, <span title="bean-like">fabaceous</span>, and, in <span title="truth">verity</span>, <span title="very varied">multifarious</span> <span title="herby">oleraceous</span> <span title="foods">edibles</span>.

        <p>There are vast <span title="very dry">arid</span> <span title="alkaline">alkaligenous</span> areas, and <span title="sandy">arenarious</span> <span title="heaps">aggerations</span>, <span title="innumerable">multitudinous</span> <span title="clustered">conglomerate</span> buttes, and <span title="washed-bare">circumdenudated</span> <span title="sandstone">arenilitic</span> elevations. Such areas not being <span title="full of springs">scaturiginous</span>, and <span title="suitable for crops">arable</span>, will ever be sparsely populated.

        <p>The <span title="money-related">nummulary</span> <span title="enlargement">majoration</span>, or <span title="increasing">crescive</span> <span title="enrichment">ditation</span> of the <span title="land tenants">terre tenants</span> originates from <span title="taking in of livestock for grazing">agistment</span>, <span title="entire purchasing">coemption</span> and <span title="selling">vendition</span> of <span title="horse">equine</span>, <span title="cow">bovine</span> and <span title="wool-bearing">lanigerous</span> <span title="sheep-like">ovine</span> <span title="four-legged aimals">quadrupeds</span>, or <span title="ox">rotherbeasts</span> from attention to <span title="scientific agriculture">geoponics</span>; from <span title="exorbitant-interest-charging">usurarious</span> contracts and usufructuary holdings; from enhancement in value of preempted <span title="land">terra firma</span>; from <span title="huntings">venations</span>, <span title="currency exchange charging">agiotage</span>, mining, <span title="mercantile">emporetical</span> pursuits, or <span title="commerce">mercature</span>, and from general negotiations.

        <p>The <span title="fewness">paucity</span> of population in some <span title="areas and neighbourhoods">localities</span> <span title="has">possesses</span> a <span title="resemblance">consimilitude</span> to a mere <span title="meagreness">exiguity</span>.

        <p>The life of many is <span title="pleasantly pastoral">bucolic</span> and <span title="wandering">nomadic</span>. In the <span title="townsman">oppidan</span> and many <span title="village">villatic</span> communities the <span title="best state">optimity</span> of society prevails. However, the <span title="hearty">cordial</span> <span title="union">compagination</span> of so <span title="mixed">heterogenous</span> a mass, and <span title="miscellaneous">farraginous</span> <span title="simultaneous occurrence">concurrence</span> of all nationalities, as is the case in some localities, demands time. There must be a prior <span title="lopping off">detruncation</span> of <span title="aggressiveness">truculence</span> and <span title="bad manners">inurbanity</span> of some of its divisions to obtain the <span title="best state">optimity</span> of society and <span title="prosperity">secundation</span>. <span title="Desire">Appetition</span> for <span title="birdcatching">aucupation</span>, <span title="hunting with dogs">cynegetics</span>, <span title="cockfighting">alectryomachy</span>, <span title="bullfighting">tauromachy</span>, and <span title="roundabout">circumforaneous</span> <span title="rovings">evagations</span>, must undergo <span title="a decrease">imminution</span>. The <span title="behaviour">comportance</span> of the major portion of the <span title="western">occidental</span> <span title="people">leod</span> is, by no means, <span title="defiant">truculent</span>, <span title="wicked">scelestic</span>, or <span title="rude">immorigerous</span>, nevertheless, many are <span title="crafty">subdolous</span>, and have a great <span title="craving">inhiation</span> for <span title="catching favor">captation</span>, <span title="usury">feneration</span>, the <span title="heaping together">coacervation</span> of <span title="ill-gotten money">pelf</span>, <span title="premature purchase">preemption</span> and <span title="entire purchase">coemption</span> of <span title="land">terra firma</span>, and participating in <span title="festive">festal</span> <span title="jollities">jovialities</span>.

        <p>The ethics of many are greatly <span title="stained">maculated</span> by the <span title="selling">vendition</span> and <span title="drinking">bibacity</span> of <span title="strong intoxicants">aqua vitae</span>. Localities <span title="full">replete</span> with <span title="kegs">cades</span> of <span title="course Spanish brandy">aguardiente</span>, <span title="cider brandy">pupelo</span>, <span title="drink">skink</span> and <span title="alcoholic malt liquor">bub</span>, are <span title="supported">patrocinated</span> by, and <span title="crowded">thronged</span> with <span title="tipplers">bibbers</span>, whose <span title="companions">comates</span>, <span title="fellow students">condisciples</span> and <span title="drinking partners">compotators</span> are <span title="idiots">dolts</span>, <span title="braggarts">fanfarons</span>, <span title="blockheads">jobbernowls</span>, <span title="silly">anserous</span> nincompoops, <span title="drunkenly sentimental">maudlin</span> <span title="wandering beggars">gaberlunzies</span>, <span title="drunken">temulent</span> <span title="fools">wantwits</span>, <span title="talkative">linguacious</span> <span title="drunkards">borachios</span>, and <span title="contentious">bateful</span> <span title="harassing litigators">barrators</span>.

        <p>They sometimes <span title="begin">initiate</span> their <span title="boisterous">saturnalian</span> <span title="festivities">revelries</span> with <span title="restrictive religious diets">xerophagy</span>, and the <span title="eating">manducation</span> of <span title="meat vegetable stews">ragouts</span>, <span title="seasoned pork sausage">saveloy</span>, and <span title="partly cooked sausage meat">polony</span>, to give <span title="a keenness">an acumen</span> to their <span title="enthusiasm">gusto</span> for the <span title="drinking">imbibition</span> of <span title="intoxicating">inebriating</span> <span title="alcoholic drinks">potations</span>. As a sequence, what <span title="babble">stultiloquence</span>! What random <span title="guessing attempts">tentations</span> at the <span title="solution">enodation</span> of some vulgar <span title="puzzle">enigma</span>! What <span title="excessive drinking">perpotation</span> and <span title="destructive">ruinous</span> <span title="drunkenness">ebriety</span>! What mutual <span title="aggressiveness">pugnacity</span> issuing in <span title="bad-tempered">testy</span> <span title="strifes">concertations</span> and <span title="bloody">sanguinary</span> <span title="fist fights">pugilisms</span>! Such <span title="meetings">rendezvous</span> are <span title="earthly">terrestrial</span> <span title="places where demons live">pandemoniums</span>.

        <p>Relative to myself; as you are <span title="aware">cognizant</span>, and for some time <span title="succeeding">subsequent</span> to my <span title="departure">discession</span> from home, I <span title="temporarily stayed">sojourned</span> with <span title="paternal kinsmen">agnations</span> and <span title="maternal kinsmen">cognations</span>, who are <span title="near-river dwellers">amnicolists</span> and engaged in <span title="agriculture">terraculture, or agricolation</span>. The <span title="surrounding">circumambient and circumjacent</span> country is <span title="between rivers">interamnian</span>, <span title="full of trees and groves">nemorous</span>, and <span title="marshy">paludal, or palustral</span>. My <span title="job">vocation</span> was at first, <span title="indoors">subtegulaneous</span> and <span title="stationary">sedentary</span>, but <span title="afterwards">subsequently</span> became wholly <span title="outdoors">extraforaneous</span>. Prior to becoming <span title="accustomed">inured</span> to a <span title="camping">castrensial</span> mode of life, I very <span title="unwisely">injudiciously</span> submitted to <span title="lying on the ground">humicubations</span> during <span title="overnight stays">pernoctations</span>; which during the initial part of my <span title="camping out">castrametations</span>, and <span title="outdoor">alfresco</span> employment, in connection with <span title="nightly">nocturnal</span> <span title="sprinklings with dew">irrorations</span>, <span title="poisonous">miasmatic</span> <span title="vapours">exhalations</span>, and <span title="dampness">dankishness</span> of the atmosphere, generated by a want of <span title="sunbathing">apricity</span>, were extremely <span title="fever-inducing">febrifacient</span>; causing <span title="every third day">tertiary</span> <span title="shaking">quassation</span> and <span title="feverishness">febriculosity</span>. <span title="Chilling">Infrigidation</span>, <span title="a creeping sensation">formication</span>, <span title="heartburn">cardialgy</span>, <span title="strange food cravings">allotriophagy</span>, and <span title="nausea">wamble</span>, succeeded by <span title="tropical delirious fever">calenture</span>, found entrance into my <span title="bodily">corporeal</span> organization. I was <span title="medicinally">medicamentally</span> <span title="helped">adjuvated</span> by a <span title="country-born">rurigenous</span> <span title="quackish">charlatanical</span> <span title="brainless">anencephalous</span> <span title="pretending doctor">medicaster</span>, who, not being extra <span title="knowledgeable">scient</span> in <span title="the science of remedies">acology</span>, <span title="the science of therapeutics">iamatology</span>, <span title="the science of salvation">soteriology</span>, <span title="the science of drugs">pharmacodynamics</span> and in the <span title="imparting">impartation</span> of <span title="discharge remedies">eccritics</span>, <span title="purgatives">ecphrastics</span>, and other <span title="drugs">pharmacons</span>, and moreover, having erroneously <span title="diagnosed">diagnosticated</span> my case, greatly <span title="lessened">minorated</span> my <span title="good digestion">eupepsy</span>, and <span title="caused">occasioned</span> me to spend many <span title="sleepless">insomnious</span> nights.

        <p>In my brief <span title="dreams">swevens</span> I endured <span title="flying arounds">circumvolation</span> of <span title="fairies">pigwidgeons</span>, <span title="evil spirits">cacodemons</span>, and <span title="hateful">odible</span> <span title="phantoms">simulachres</span> in my <span title="brain">harns</span>. Upon these <span title="came about">supervened</span> <span title="dog-like appetite">cynorexia</span>, <span title="oedematous cold sweats">leucophlegmacy</span>, <span title="swollen">turgid</span> <span title="jaws">muns</span>, and <span title="quinine deafness">cinchonism</span>. I am now robust physically and sane mentally, or <span title="a healthy mind in a healthy body">mens sana in corpora sano</span>, with the exception of a slight <span title="toothache">odontalgia</span> and <span title="headache">cephalalgia</span>, but not the slightest symptom of <span title="homesickness">nostalgia</span>. <span title="Great praise">Eulogium</span> to the <span title="above-world">supermundane</span> powers for the <span title="restoration">revivification</span> of my physical organization, and for my <span title="strength">invalescence</span> and complete <span title="recovery">analepsis</span> by means of <span title="fever medicines">antipyretics</span>, <span title="liver medicines">cholagogics</span>, <span title="digestion medicines">peptics</span>, <span title="burning fever medicines">anticausotics</span>, and other <span title="medicines">medicaments</span>; also, <span title="disease treatments by bathing">balneotherapy</span>, <span title="disease treatments by muscular movements">kinesipathy, or kinesiatrics</span>, and <span title="movement">migration</span> to this <span title="healthy">salubrious</span> <span title="climate">clime</span>.

        <p>Since my <span title="occupancy">ubication</span> here, my functions have been <span title="book-selling">bibliopolistical</span>, <span title="herding">bucolical</span>, <span title="farming">agronomical</span>, <span title="teaching">paideutical</span>, and <span title="negotiations">negotiatory</span>. I have <span title="wandered">pererrated</span> the <span title="west">ponent</span> regions quite extensively, and have witnessed many <span title="strange things">peregrinities</span>, and <span title="new">neoteric</span> <span title="happenings">occurrences</span>.

        <p>I will now <span title="end">terminate</span> this <span title="drawn out">protracted</span>, <span title="offhand">autoschediastical</span> <span title="scribbling">scribblement</span> by <span title="bestowing">imparting</span> to you the <span title="truth">verity</span>, that as yet, <span title="womanliness">feminality</span> has not <span title="dangerously">parlously</span> <span title="bewitched">effascinated</span> me, though I am not by any means, a <span title="woman hater">misogynist</span> or a <span title="marriage hater">misogamist</span>; affected with neither <span title="adoration of women">gyneolatry</span> or <span title="fear of women">gynephobia</span>; thought somewhat of a <span title="friend of women">philogynist</span>. <span title="Desiring">Desiderating</span> not to be <span title="shackled">gyved</span> with <span title="marital">connubial</span> relations, I have come to the <span title="conclusion">illation</span> to be <span title="wandering alone">solivagant</span> yet many <span title="years">annuary epochs</span>.

        <p>I shall offer no <span title="defense">exculpation</span> for <span title="difficult to read">hieroglyphical</span> <span title="handwriting">chirography</span>, <span title="offhand">autoschediastical</span> <span title="use of words">orthology</span>, <span title="bad spellings">cacography</span> and <span title="bad choice of words">cacology</span>; but leaving it to you to <span title="decode">decipher</span>, <span title="find the derivations of">etymologize</span>, and <span title="clarify">eclaircize</span>, to the best of your <span title="word-defining">lexigraphical</span>, <span title="word-using">lexicological</span>, <span title="technical-term-treating">orismological</span>, and <span title="language history and development">philological</span> abilities.

        <h1>Letter II,</h1>
        <h2>Mirage Plateau, <span title="West">Occident</span></h2>
        <h3>Dec. 3, 1872</h3>


        <p>Most <span title="Self-taught">Automathic</span> and <span title="Language-knowing">Glottological</span> Sir:

        <p>In my <span title="previous">prevenient</span> <span title="far-fetched">catachrestical</span> <span title="letter-like">epistolographical</span> <span title="written message">missive</span>, I <span title="tried">essayed</span> to portray to you the <span title="local geography">chorography</span> of the portion of the <span title="western">ponent</span> regions. My present <span title="night time composition">elucubration</span> shall be <span title="story-telling">narratory</span> of incidents in my <span title="uncertain">chequered</span> experience here.

        <p>The caravan with which I <span title="travelled">traversed</span> the <span title="western">occidental</span> <span title="high plain">plateau</span>, reached its destination during the <span title="dog">canicular</span> days. Here, <span title="following">subsequent to</span> the <span title="delay">tarriance</span> of several <span title="weeks">hebdomads</span>, having <span title="a strong desire">an appetency</span> to <span title="travel for survey">perlustrate</span> the <span title="western">Hesperian</span> domain still further, I entered into a <span title="pact settled">pactitious</span> agreement as <span title="nomadic">peripatetic</span> <span title="habitually travelling">itinerant</span> <span title="bookseller">bibliopole</span>.

        <p>This was quite <span title="suitable">consentaneous</span> with my nature; for, as you know, from my earliest <span title="youth">juvenility</span>, I have been <span title="a passionate">an ardent</span> <span title="book lover">bibliophilist</span>.

        <p>Receiving a <span title="shortened and abridged">compendiarious</span> <span title="summary">prospectus</span>, I <span title="uttered">prolated</span> <span title="goodbyes">valedictions</span> to my <span title="fellow travelers">"compagnos de voyage"</span> and <span title="began">inchoated</span> <span title="lone-wandering">solivagant</span> <span title="traveling inspection">perambulations</span>.

        <p>I now realized the fact that I was in a <span title="foreign">peregrine</span> land, <span title="unknown">unkent</span>, a <span title="stranger">fren</span>, <span title="an itinerant">a peripatetic</span> <span title="going on foot">pedestrious</span> <span title="traveler">viator</span>, and apparently <span title="alone">isolated</span>, with the <span title="exception">salvo</span> of a <span title="dog-like">canine</span> <span title="four-legged animal">quadruped</span>, whose <span title="biting">mordacious</span>, <span title="barking">latrant</span>, <span title="sportive">lusorious</span>, and <span title="hunting">venatic</span> qualities are without <span title="equal degree">parity</span>.

        <p><span title="Tamed">Cicurated</span> and <span title="deprived">divested</span> of his <span title="savage fierceness">acharnement</span> and <span title="peevishness">curstness</span>, he has been of great <span title="use">utility</span> to me in his <span title="searching out">indagation</span> of game in their <span title="lyings in concealment">latitations</span>, <span title="burrows">latibulums</span>, or <span title="winter abiding places">hibernaculums</span>; and for his <span title="careful watchings">pervigilations</span>. By his <span title="Cerberus-like">cerberean</span> <span title="barkings">latrations</span>, he has kept in <span title="suspension">abeyance</span> the whole <span title="night-wandering">noctivagant</span> <span title="thievish">furacious</span> race; especially, during the <span title="night-time">nocturnal</span> hours.

        <p>I <span title="burdened">onerated</span> my <span title="back">dorsal</span> part with a <span title="leather bag">portmanteau</span> for the <span title="carrying">vectitation</span> of my <span title="garments">habiliments</span>. My <span title="upper arm">humeral</span>, or <span title="shoulder blade outer extremity">acromial</span> <span title="jutting beyond the surface">projecture</span>, I also <span title="burdened">onerated</span> with an instrument consisting of <span title="woody">ligneous</span> stock and <span title="iron">ferreous</span> tube, for the <span title="killing off">enecation</span> of <span title="winged">aligerous</span> and <span title="flying">volant</span> <span title="two-legged creatures">bipeds</span>, and those animals that are given to <span title="theft">latrociny</span>, or a <span title="predatory">predacious</span> life.

        <p>With this <span title="protective outfit">armature</span> of <span title="accessory clothings">accoutrements</span>, I took up my line of march in a <span title="north-western">septentrio-occidental</span> direction, for distant <span title="town">oppidan</span> and <span title="village">villatic</span> communities. <span title="Increasing">Amplifying</span> <span title="clearness">claritude</span> occupied the <span title="silvery">argent</span> fields above; human, <span title="beasty">belluine</span>, and other entities sustained the radiating <span title="heat">caloric</span> of <span title="the Sun">Phoebus</span>. Exhilirating <span title="sweet sounds">euphony</span> seemed to possess entire <span title="existence in all places">ubiquity</span>. Under this <span title="rising">buoyant</span> physical <span title="renewal of life">revivification</span> I <span title="passed over">transcended</span> <span title="uphills">acclivities</span> and <span title="downhills">declivities</span>, until the <span title="darting forth">rayonnant</span> solar <span title="heavenly light-giving body">luminary</span> had attained <span title="noon">meridonial</span> <span title="height">arduity</span>, pouring down upon me his <span title="heating">calefactory</span> radiations; so that my <span title="bodily">corporeal</span> organization was, in totality, subjected to redundant <span title="sweatings">sudations</span>, necessitating me to bring my <span title="silken">bombycinous</span> <span title="handkerchief">sudary</span> into frequent <span title="need">requisition</span>. After having participated in a <span title="cold luncheon">collation</span>, I submitted my <span title="body">corporeity</span> to <span title="rest">quiescence</span> in a <span title="lying on the back">resupine</span> position; which proved very <span title="weariness-relieving">acopic</span>, and <span title="brought about">effectuated</span> <span title="a restoration">an instauration</span> of my physical energies. Having indulged in something like <span title="drowsy stretching">pandiculation</span>, at least, a sort of involuntary <span title="bodyweight">calisthenical</span> exercise, I resumed the <span title="lengthening">elongation</span> of my <span title="walking">pedaneous</span> <span title="travelling">locomotion</span>, and <span title="drew out">protracted</span> it well past <span title="dusk">crepuscule</span>. Thus ended my <span title="first">primal</span> days <span title="walking">itineration</span>, varied by a <span title="great many">multiplicity</span> of <span title="strange things">peregrinities</span> and <span title="new">neoteric</span> <span title="happenings">occurrences</span>.

        <p>But oh! My <span title="weariness">defatigation</span> and the <span title="swelling">turgescence</span> of my <span title="feet">pedalian</span> extremities! The <span title="callous and hardened">cataphracted</span> <span title="skin">epidermal</span> <span title="covering">integument</span> <span title="rubbed off">abraded</span> from my <span title="ankle joint">malleolar</span> processes and <span title="heel">calcaneal</span> <span title="bulges">protrusions</span>. My <span title="left">sinistral</span> tendo-achilles and the <span title="back">dorsal</span> part of my <span title="right">dextral</span> <span title="big toe">hallux</span> extensively <span title="blistered">vesicated</span> and <span title="chafed">excoriated</span>. But you know, the <span title="beginning">initial</span> part of all enterprises is <span title="laborious">arduous</span>.

        <p><span title="Following">Subsequently to</span> a very <span title="luxurious">sumptuous</span> <span title="evening">vespertine</span> <span title="meal">repast</span>, I <span title="hinted">intimated</span> to the caterer for human and <span title="beastly">belluine</span> <span title="animal existence">animality</span> that, feeling quite <span title="greatly">superlatively</span> <span title="weak in the loins">elumbated</span>, and being somewhat <span title="drowsy">somniculous</span>, I was <span title="disposed">propense</span> to an early <span title="bedtime reception">couchee</span>; and requested that he <span title="point out">indigitate</span> to me a <span title="bedroom">cubicular</span> department, or dormitory, in which I might enjoy <span title="sleep-inducing">somniferous</span> <span title="quietness">quietude</span>. I <span title="aroused">elicited</span> from my host an <span title="obligation">obstriction</span> to cause my <span title="waking up">experrection</span> when the <span title="dimness">caligation</span> of the night was yielding to the <span title="clearness">clarity</span> of the <span title="returning">remeant</span> <span title="east-rising">exortive</span> solar sphere. <span title="Before">Prior to</span> <span title="lying down">decumbency</span> on my couch, I submitted my <span title="feet">pedal</span> and <span title="leg">crural</span> organs to a <span title="purification">defecation</span> by a <span title="plentiful">copious</span> <span title="cleansing">lavation</span> with <span title="medicinally furnished">medicated</span> <span title="soapy">saponaceous</span> <span title="detergents">abstergents</span>.

        <p>This <span title="feet bathing">pediluvy</span> and <span title="ritual washing">ablution</span>, though I yet suffered a slight <span title="twitching">vellication</span> in my <span title="thigh">femoral</span> organs, gave me a <span title="proneness">proclivity</span> for an indulgence of my <span title="sleepiness">somnolency</span> without <span title="intervention">intercission</span>. In the <span title="early morning">matin</span>, according to <span title="contract">paction</span>, the <span title="inn-keeper">aubergist</span> <span title="excited">exsuscitated</span> me at the first <span title="melodious">canorous</span> <span title="bell-like sounds">peal</span> of the <span title="young rooster">chanticleer</span>. After the customary <span title="morning">matutinal</span> <span title="hand">manal</span> and <span title="face">facial</span> <span title="cleansing">ablution</span> and <span title="wiping clean">abstersion</span>, and <span title="head">capital</span> <span title="combing">pectination</span>, and a very satisfactory <span title="filling up">impletion</span> of my <span title="stomach">epigastric</span> <span title="repository">receptacle</span>. I asked for the <span title="reckoning">supputation</span> with him; and having duly adjusted the same, I resumed <span title="walking">ambulatory</span> <span title="motion on foot">incession</span>. The <span title="sky-blue">ceruleous</span> canopy was merging into <span title="splendor">fulgidity</span> from the ascending <span title="darting forth">rayonnant</span> <span title="Sun">Phoebus</span>. Every <span title="being">entity</span> about me seemed to <span title="take delight">revel</span> in universal <span title="reviving">resuscitation</span>. I performed my <span title="daily">quotidian</span> <span title="moving from place to place">locomotion</span> for several <span title="days">diurnal revolutions</span>; witnessing a <span title="multitude">multiplicity</span> of occurrences <span title="similar">homologous</span> to those already specified.

        <p>One day, when the <span title="Sun">solar sphere</span> had <span title="reached a peak">culminated</span>, I, being much <span title="exhausted">exantlated</span> from continuous <span title="walkings abroad">deambulation</span>, gave way to a <span title="leaning upon">recubation</span> under an isolated, <span title="many-branched">multiramose</span>, <span title="shady">umbrageous</span> tree, <span title="bordering">attiguous to</span> the trail, for the purpose of exercising my <span title="chewing organs">masticators</span> upon the contents of my <span title="journey provisions">viaticum</span>. Having furnished <span title="strength restoration by refreshment">refocillation</span> to my system, <span title="lying back">recumbent</span> on my <span title="back">dorsal</span> part, I viewed the <span title="feathery">plumous</span> <span title="dwellers">tenants</span> of the air in their <span title="flying around">evolutions</span> among the <span title="branches">ramifications</span> of the tree, and the <span title="deceptive">illusive</span> mirage in the distance. Having <span title="removed shoes">discalceated</span>, I <span title="rubbed over">perfricated</span> my <span title="sore-becoming">recrudescent</span> and <span title="worn by friction">attrited</span> <span title="feet">pedal</span> organs with an <span title="anointing">iatroleptical</span> <span title="waxy and oily ointment">cerate</span>, and then, becoming <span title="overcome">profligated</span> with <span title="sleepiness">somnolency</span>, I <span title="fell back">relapsed</span> into a <span title="post-dinner">post prandial</span> <span title="early afternoon nap">siesta</span>. Schnell, for that was the <span title="surname">cognomination</span> of my <span title="dog">canine</span> <span title="friend">companion</span> and <span title="guard">presidiary</span>, - <span title="carefully watched">advigilated</span>. I was, however soon <span title="excited">suscitated</span> by an electrical detonation from the <span title="northern">septentrional</span> part of the horizon. So soon as my <span title="eyes">ophthalmic organs</span> had undergone <span title="opening">patefaction</span>, I realized that <span title="cloud-bearing">nubiferous</span> gales were in operation, <span title="rolling up">agglomerating</span> a most <span title="threatening">ominous</span> and <span title="imminent">impendent</span> <span title="rain storm">cumu-cirro-stratus</span> <span title="cloud">thunderhead</span>. The <span title="visible sky">welkin</span> was rapidly <span title="becoming clouded">obnubilating</span>, and <span title="darkness">tenebrosity</span> <span title="increasing">amplifying</span>. The <span title="curlings">crispations</span> and <span title="forkings">furcations</span> of the <span title="lightning strikes">fulgurations</span> became <span title="bright and strong">vivid</span>, and the <span title="thunder claps">fulminations</span> <span title="dreadful sounding">horrisonous</span>. In a <span title="shortness">brevity</span> of time there was a <span title="plentiful">copious</span> <span title="downpour">precipitation</span> of <span title="rain">pluvious</span> <span title="drops">globules</span>, which subjected me and Schnell to thorough <span title="soaking">madefaction</span>.

        <p>The <span title="water courses">arroyos</span> assumed such <span title="enlargements">ampliations</span> as might be <span title="called">instyled</span> a local <span title="outpouring">torrential</span> <span title="earthly catastrophe">cataclysm</span>. <span title="Watery">Aqueous</span> domination prevailed on earth; <span title="fiery">igneous</span> <span title="power">potency</span> and <span title="thundery">fulmineous</span> <span title="echoes">reverberations</span> <span title="overpowered">predominated</span> in the <span title="cloud-bearing">nubiferous</span> regions; and <span title="an overpowering">a resistless</span> <span title="windiness">ventosity</span> maintained <span title="frightful">horrendous</span> <span title="roaring">boation</span> in the atmosphere. The <span title="lightnings">fulgurations</span> communicated their <span title="fiery">igneous</span> <span title="power">potency</span> to a <span title="cabin">rancho</span> <span title="without">sans</span> <span title="lightning rods">paratonnerres</span>, setting in it <span title="intense fire">flagration</span>; <span title="ending">terminating</span> in entire <span title="burning to ashes">incineration</span>. Being <span title="uninhabited">untenanted</span>, no one fell a prey to cremation. I and Schnell had to engage in the <span title="leaping across">transilience</span> and <span title="swimming across">tranation</span> of several <span title="water courses">arroyos</span>; which greatly <span title="added to">augmented</span> the <span title="heaviness">ponderosity</span> of our <span title="coverings">envelopes</span>. Ultimately, as the day began to <span title="turn to evening">advesperate</span>, but <span title="before">prior to</span> the <span title="going down">cadence</span> of <span title="the Sun">Phoebus</span>, - with <span title="foot">pedal</span> <span title="coverings">envelopes</span> and the <span title="lower">inferior</span> portion of my <span title="thigh">femoral</span> <span title="clothes">habiliments</span> subjected to quite <span title="a mud bath">an illutation</span>, I arrived at <span title="a mud brick">an adobe</span> <span title="herdsman's hut">chalet</span>.

        <p><span title="Anthracite-like">Anthracitic</span> and <span title="wooden">ligneous</span> <span title="burnable things">combustibles</span> were deposited in a <span title="roomy">spacious</span> <span title="heater">calefactor</span>, and <span title="set on fire">accended</span> with <span title="a lighting match">an allumette</span>, giving me an opportunity for <span title="roasting dry">torrefaction</span>, or <span title="driving out of vapours">divaporation</span>. I was soon summoned to the <span title="refreshment room">refectory</span> by <span title="bell">tintinnabular</span> <span title="echoes">reverberations</span>, where I found <span title="plentiful">ample</span> <span title="supper">cenatory</span> refreshments.

        <p><span title="Darkness">Tenebrosity</span> having by this time encircled our <span title="half">moiety</span> of <span title="Earth">this mundane sphere</span>, I soon sank into the <span title="embrace">gremium</span> of <span title="the Roman god of sleep and dreams">Morpheus</span>.

        <p>The day <span title="following">subsequent to</span> the <span title="stormy">procellous</span> <span title="evening">vesper</span> on which I <span title="brought about">effectuated</span> the <span title="heating">arefaction, or calefaction</span> of my <span title="items of clothing">habiliments</span> was not very <span title="conducive">inservient</span> to the progress of a <span title="foot-going">pedestrious</span> <span title="traveler">viator</span>. It is true, the atmospheric regions, at first <span title="somewhat cloudy">subnuvolar</span>, soon became <span title="cleared from clouds">enubilated</span>; and <span title="the Sun">old Sol</span> did not radiate his <span title="sweat-causing">sudorific</span> <span title="heat">caloric</span> so <span title="powerfully">potently</span> as on <span title="yesterday">the hesternal day</span>, but the roads had, in some places, become <span title="muddy">lutulent</span> and somewhat <span title="sticky and foul">clarty</span>; presenting great <span title="difficulty">difficiliation</span> to my incessant velocity, on account of the <span title="stickiness">viscosity</span> of the surface.

        <p><span title="Following">In consequent</span> my frequent <span title="stops">stoppages</span>, on account of the <span title="muddy">lutarious</span> and <span title="rough">salebrous</span> condition of the trail, I had <span title="plentiful">ample</span> opportunity to exercise my <span title="eyes">optics</span> upon the aspects of the <span title="bordering">circumjacent</span> regions. The <span title="bends and turns">sinuosities</span> of the <span title="valleys">vales</span>; the <span title="rocky">rupellary</span> <span title="deep water worn gorges">canons</span>; the <span title="large">titanic</span>, <span title="rough">scabrous</span>, <span title="snow">nival</span> crested <span title="everlasting">Aeonian</span> mountain peaks; the <span title="fruitfulness">feracity</span> of the <span title="earthy">terreous</span> surface <span title="reaching to">pertingent to</span> the <span title="watery">aqueous</span> <span title="stream curves">meanders</span>, excited in me the greatest <span title="pleasing">oblectation</span>. I arrived one day at a place somewhat <span title="having many roads">multivious</span>; and there being no <span title="milestone">milliaries</span> or <span title="road distance measuring">odometrous</span> stones, I soon became disoriented. In the course of my <span title="walkings abroad">deambulations</span>, my vision was <span title="treated">regaled</span> with <span title="a western">an occiduous</span>, <span title="flower-bearing">floriferous</span> savanna; having in its <span title="northern">septentrional</span>, <span title="eastern">oriental</span>, and <span title="southern">austral</span> sections, a slight <span title="sinking in the ground">subsidence</span>. Its <span title="earthy">terreous</span> surface was a perfect <span title="mellow earth">chessom</span>, wholly <span title="not rough">nonscatebrous</span>. In my <span title="passing across">transcursion</span> to a designated point, my attention was <span title="seized">arrested</span> by the <span title="hearing">audition</span> of a very <span title="strong">puissant</span> <span title="hissing">sibilation</span> in great <span title="nearness">proximity</span> to Schnell. He gave a <span title="sudden">subitaneous</span> <span title="leaping back">resilience</span>. By <span title="cautious">chary</span> <span title="searching">perscrutation</span>, I perceived a <span title="fork-tongued">fissilingual</span>, <span title="frog-eating">batrachophagous</span>, <span title="snake-like">anguine</span> <span title="creeping reptile">creeple</span>, a <span title="large rattle snake">crotalus</span>, circularly <span title="lying">recumbent</span>. His <span title="skin">cutaneous</span> <span title="covering">envelope</span> was <span title="scaly">squamous</span>, <span title="coppery">cupreous</span>, and <span title="shiny">fulgid</span>. His <span title="tail">caudal extremity</span> was <span title="pointed">cuspidated</span> with a <span title="horny">corneous</span> <span title="peak">apex</span>. Schnell made a <span title="reckless">temerarious</span> <span title="leaping upon">supersalient</span> <span title="attack">assault</span> upon him, but received such a <span title="hard blow">siserary</span> upon his <span title="nose">rhinal protrusion</span> as immediately induced incessant <span title="tossing of the body">jactitation</span>. <span title="Swelling">Tumefaction</span> with <span title="indescribable">ineffable</span> <span title="quickness">celerity</span> became visible in his <span title="body">physical organization</span>. Being somewhat <span title="versed">scient</span> in <span title="the science of poison treatments">toxicology</span> and <span title="the theory of the medical profession">pantagruelism</span>, I administered to him, in the utmost <span title="shortness">brevity</span> of time, <span title="poison remedies">alexiterics</span>, <span title="inflammation remedies">antiphlogistics</span>, and other pharmacy. This treatment produced immediate <span title="reduction of swelling">detumescence</span> and <span title="recovery">revalescence</span>. Though this assault upon him did not prove <span title="fatal">exitial</span>, yet, in his <span title="springing back">resilience</span> from the <span title="fabled serpent">dipsas</span> he suffered the <span title="joint dislocation">exarticulation</span>, or rather, the <span title="partial dislocation">subluxation</span> of his <span title="left">sinistral</span> <span title="leg">crural organ</span>; which, in his <span title="following">subsequent</span> <span title="runnings about">circumcursations</span>, <span title="forced">extorted</span> the most <span title="noisy">streperous</span> <span title="outcries">ejaculations</span>. He soon however, enjoyed complete <span title="soundness">sanation</span>, and was freed from every traumatic <span title="trace">vestige</span>, and relieved of all <span title="violent fixed bone pain">osteocope</span> by a <span title="pain relieving medicine">nepenthe and antalgics</span>. His <span title="beneath the stars">subastral</span> <span title="life">vitality</span> has, however, since <span title="ended">terminated</span>. Fritz, a <span title="camp">castrensian</span> <span title="assistant">acolythist</span> of mine, <span title="a passionate">an ardent</span> lover of <span title="hunting with dogs">cynegetics</span> and <span title="birdcatching">aucupation</span>, made a <span title="bird-shooting">pteriplegistic</span> <span title="hunting">venatorial</span> tour, and induced Schnell to accompany him. On the succeeding <span title="morning">matin</span>, as they were <span title="drawing near">appropinquating</span> a <span title="stony">lapideous</span> and <span title="rocky">scopulous</span> elevation, Schnell, in his <span title="running abouts">circumcursations</span>, - <span title="at full speed">ventre a terre</span>, - was <span title="allured">allected</span> by the <span title="meat odor">fumette</span> of a <span title="place for hiding provisions">cache</span>. He there <span title="by chance">habnab</span>, met a <span title="shaggy">hirsute</span>, <span title="horse-eating">hippophagous</span>, <span title="flesh-eating">sarcophagous</span>, <span title="fish-eating">ichthyophagous</span>, <span title="honey-eating">melliphagous</span>, <span title="insect-eating">insectivorous</span>, <span title="worm-eating">vermivorous</span>, <span title="fruit-eating">frugivorous</span>, and <span title="man-eating">anthropophagous</span> <span title="bear-like">ursine</span> <span title="four-legged animal">quadruped</span>. A terrific <span title="bloody">sanguinary</span> <span title="dog and bear fight">cynarctomachy</span> <span title="followed">ensued</span>. In the <span title="rolling arounds">circumgyrations</span> of the <span title="fighters">battailants</span>, Schnell rendered <span title="bear">Bruin</span> <span title="tailless">excaudate</span>; but <span title="bear">Bruin</span> being <span title="clawed">unguiculated</span>, seized Schnell with one paw by the <span title="nose">neb</span> and <span title="under jaw">submaxillary</span> appendage in the <span title="front of neck">hyomental</span> region, and with the other, grasped his <span title="hairy">capillose</span> <span title="skin">dermal</span> <span title="protective covering">integument</span> in the lateral part, and almost <span title="emboweled">exenterated</span> him, and quite <span title="viciously beat">suggilated</span> him. By an extra <span title="effort">conatus</span>, Schnell effected his <span title="struggling">eluctation</span> from <span title="bear">Bruin</span>; but through <span title="out of the fight">hors de combat</span>, his <span title="limping">claudication</span> from the arena of <span title="strife">concertation</span>, or <span title="resistance">obluctation</span>, prompted the most <span title="powerful">puissant</span> <span title="dog howls">ululations</span>. The <span title="torn up conditions">lancinations</span>, <span title="despite">mauger</span> all <span title="skin healing">epulotic</span>, <span title="bone healing">catagmatic</span> and <span title="scar healing">cicatrisive</span> appliances, and all available <span title="surgical">aciurgical and chirurgical</span> skill, - <span title="became gangrenous">sphacelated</span>. <span title="Between bones">Interosseal</span> and <span title="neck">cervical</span> <span title="swelling">inturgescence</span> induced <span title="quinsy">angina</span>; terminating in <span title="death">lethality</span>. He was <span title="buried">contumulated</span> <span title="respectably">farantly</span>.

        <p>After <span title="receiving hospitality">hospitating</span> for a <span title="night and day">noctidial</span> period with a <span title="cowboy">vaquero</span>, I entered into a <span title="settled by agreement">pactitious</span> contract with him. During my <span title="apprenticeship">tyrociny</span> as <span title="cowboy">vaquero</span>, though not a <span title="beginner">novice</span> in <span title="horsemanship">equitancy</span>, and riding <span title="galloping violently">tantivy</span>, yet, in segregating and <span title="penning">corraling</span> <span title="long-horned">macrocornous</span> <span title="cows">bovines</span> for <span title="branding">inustion</span>; in <span title="hodgepodge">omnium-gatherum</span> aggregations, or rodeos, and in <span title="leading out">abgregating</span> <span title="strays">mavericks</span>, - my <span title="horse riding">equestrian</span> acrobatic feats, - vaulting from the <span title="back">dorsal</span> part of bucking bronchos, - was, for a time, truly, <span title="wonderful to behold">mirabile visu</span>.

        <p>Eventually, in view of the <span title="flying away">avolation</span>, or <span title="fading away">evanescence</span> of the <span title="summer">aestival</span> and <span title="autumn">autumnal</span> seasons, and the approximation of <span title="winter">brumal</span> <span title="coldness">gelidity</span>, and <span title="falling">cadent</span> <span title="snowy">niveous</span> particles, and moreover, being <span title="from the country">ruricolist</span> rather than <span title="a townsman">an oppidan</span>, I entered in <span title="an agreement">a paction</span> with <span title="a western">an occiduous</span> <span title="businessman">proprietor</span> of a section of <span title="land">terra firma</span>.

        <p>In conclusion, I will say, - I have today felt somewhat <span title="inclined to write">writative</span>, and hence, my present <span title="letter-writing">epistolizing</span> is <span title="large in volume">voluminous</span> as Thucydides, and strung out like the <span title="tail">caudal appendage</span> of Alcibiades' <span title="dog">canine</span>. I have <span title="writing on the back">opisthographized</span> much; <span title="annotated">postillated</span> <span title="corrective">emendatory</span> criticisms here and there, and added so much <span title="rewording to clarify">paraphrastical</span> <span title="margin notes">marginalia</span>, that <span title="truly">verily</span> - <span title="it smells of lamp">"redolet lucernae"</span>.

        <p>With <span title="usual">accustomary</span> <span title="good will">comity</span>

        <p>Most <span title="Learning Loving">Philomathic</span> and <span title="Fine Penmanship">Calligraphical</span> Sir:

        <p>In the <span title="close">finale</span> of my last <span title="composed by candlelight">lucubratory</span> <span title="letter-like">epistolary</span> <span title="manuscript erased clean for reuse">palimpsest</span>, I gave you <span title="awareness">cognizance</span> of the <span title="truth">verity</span>, that at the <span title="beginning">inchoation</span> of the <span title="frosty">pruinous</span> season, I entered into <span title="an agreement">a paction</span> with a certain <span title="western">ponent</span> <span title="farmer">agricultor</span>. I am not <span title="skillful">au fait</span> in <span title="the right description of things">orthology</span>, but I will <span title="try">essay</span> to <span title="give">impart</span> to you <span title="knowledge">cognition</span> of my position during my <span title="residing">commoration</span> with the said <span title="brainless">excerebrous</span> <span title="devilish">mephistophelian</span> <span title="farmer">agricolist</span>. Such <span title="severe discipline">scleragogy</span>! Such a <span title="lengthening">protraction</span> of <span title="life">vitality</span>! The <span title="littleness">parvitude</span> of his <span title="extremely dirty">augean</span>, <span title="flea-bitten">pulicous</span> <span title="abode">habitance</span>! The <span title="sooty">fuliginous</span> <span title="stove">calefactor</span> with carbon fuel; the <span title="chinkiness">rimosity</span>, or <span title="opening">fatiscence</span> of its walls; the <span title="thinness">tenuity</span> of the <span title="bed">thoral</span> <span title="furniture">greith</span>, or <span title="protective covering">integuments</span>, - <span title="full">replete</span> with <span title="blood-eating">sanguinivorous</span> <span title="bedbugs">cimisses</span>, - are indeed <span title="weak">asthenic</span> <span title="protectives">defensatives</span> against the <span title="coldness">algidity</span> induced by the <span title="chilling">frigorific</span> <span title="blow throughs">perflations</span> of the <span title="north wind">Aquilon</span> and <span title="south-eastern wind">Caecias</span>.

        <p>Our <span title="food">edibles</span>, or <span title="bad food">cagmag</span>, consisted of <span title="bran">furfuraceous</span> cakes, <span title="unleavened">azymous</span> <span title="oat-breads">jannocks</span>, <span title="musty">fusty</span> <span title="sausages">chitterlings</span>, <span title="jerked beef">charqui</span>, <span title="vegetable hash">lobscouse</span>, and a <span title="thin">tenuous</span> <span title="tasteless">insapory</span> <span title="soup">puree</span>.

        <p>The <span title="arising from unknown causes">idiopathic</span> <span title="small-headed">microcephalous</span> <span title="head of the family">paterfamilias</span> and <span title="owner">dominus</span> of the <span title="house">domicile</span>, is <span title="arrogant">fastuous</span>, <span title="contentious">brigose</span>, and possessed of a most <span title="unquestionably demonstrated">apodeictical</span> <span title="self-love">philauty</span>. He is a <span title="peculiar man">genio</span> - a <span title="virtuoso">curioso</span>. A conformity to his <span title="meticulous">punctilious</span> <span title="devotion to rules">precisianism</span>, is, <span title="truly">veritably</span>, a <span title="debatable point">quodlibet</span>. He coerced me to <span title="toil">moider</span> during the <span title="daytime">diurnal</span> period, like a <span title="donkey">moke</span>, and harassed me with <span title="before day">antelucan</span> <span title="senseless babbling">blatterations</span>. He is <span title="much named">multinomious, or polyonomous</span>, as I have <span title="given many titles to">multititulated</span> him, <span title="loud mouthed">Megalophon</span> <span title="fatty">Fustilugs</span> <span title="blockhead">Dizzard</span> <span title="coward">Culion</span> <span title="braggart">Rodomont</span> <span title="disbeliever">Pyrrhonist</span>. His <span title="perverseness">tetricity</span>, <span title="deficiency">carency</span> of <span title="goodness">bonity</span>, <span title="hospitality">xenodochy</span>, <span title="hatred of others">aphilanthropy</span>, <span title="little mindedness">parvanimity</span>, and abnormal <span title="ascription of human nature to God">anthropophuism</span>, are <span title="unnatural">antipathetical</span> to his <span title="local">vicinal</span> <span title="contemporaries">cotemporaries</span> and the <span title="sojourners">metics</span> in his <span title="neighborhood">convicinity</span>.

        <p>As to his <span title="numerous-offspring-having">proletaneous</span>, <span title="large bellied">abdominous</span>, <span title="golden haired">flavicomous</span>, <span title="projecting-lower-jawed">hypognathous</span>, <span title="pitted">foveated</span> <span title="freckle">fraken</span> <span title="faced">visaged</span> <span title="onion-eating">cepevorous</span>, <span title="noisy">vociferous</span> consort, I have <span title="named">appellated and yclept</span> her, - <span title="Fatness">Oleosity</span> <span title="Immodesty">Impudicity</span> Amazon <span title="Scolding Woman">Rixatrix</span> <span title="Uncleanness">Immundicity</span>. The passing of the <span title="thin">macilent</span> <span title="Enormous cow">Chichevache</span> never <span title="shudders at">agrises</span> or causes her the least <span title="bristling of the hairs">horripilation</span>.

        <p>Having become <span title="one who acknowledges no superior">an acephalist</span>, and <span title="tired">fatigated</span> with <span title="unremitting">assiduate</span> <span title="more than needed">supererogatory</span> <span title="servile">vernile</span> toil, I <span title="shortened">protracted</span> my <span title="sleep">obdormition</span> according to <span title="independent of external authority">autocephalous</span> <span title="authoritative judgment">arbitrament</span>, <span title="despite">mauger</span> all his <span title="loud sounding">stentorophonic</span> <span title="senseless babblings">blatterations</span> and <span title="noisiness">perstreperousness</span> to <span title="arouse">exsuscitate</span> me. This occasioned a <span title="brawl">rixation</span> which eventuated in my <span title="stretching out">prolating</span> a very <span title="disapproval expressing">dyslogistic</span> <span title="everlasting">sempiternal</span> <span title="farewell">valediction</span> to his <span title="cursed">maledicted</span> bye. This was in <span title="agreement">consension</span> with <span title="earnestness">affectuosity</span>; for I would rather be a <span title="world-wandering">mundivagant</span> than a <span title="serving">latreutical</span> mercenary, and fraternize with and be <span title="under rule">ditionary</span>, or <span title="capable of being subjected">subjicible</span> to such <span title="a brainless">an excerebrous</span>, abysmally <span title="ignorant">nescient</span> a <span title="tribe">sept</span> as his.

        <p>I resumed <span title="wandering">circumforaneous</span> <span title="book selling">bibliopolistical</span> functions, and after the <span title="progression">profection</span> of about a <span title="three day">triduan</span> period subsequent to <span title="uttering">prolating</span> my <span title="everlasting">eviternal</span> adieu to the <span title="poor quality">execrable</span> <span title="agriculture">terraculturist</span> and <span title="hut">rancho</span> with a drastic <span title="delivered in retreat">Parthian</span> shot, I approximated an <span title="urban">urbiculous</span> community; in the <span title="suburb">suburbicarian</span> precincts, or <span title="outskirts">purlieus</span> of which I beheld <span title="a miscellaneous collection">an omnium-gatherum</span> <span title="crowd of common people">rabblement</span>, consisting of <span title="wenches">queans</span>, <span title="laughing girls">giglets</span>, <span title="drabs">malkins</span>, <span title="drudges">cinderwenches</span>, <span title="merry people">galliards</span>, <span title="beggars">mumpers</span>, <span title="upstarts">skipjacks</span>, <span title="old women">beldames</span>, <span title="lovers">belamours</span>, <span title="foul-mouthed fellows">cuttles</span>, <span title="thieves">michers</span>, <span title="stupid fellows">clumps</span>, <span title="triflers">doodles</span>, nincompoops, cosmopolitans, <span title="misers">curmudgeons</span>, <span title="half wits">ninnyhammers</span>, <span title="ragtags">tatterdemalions</span>, <span title="awkward adolescent boys">hobbledehoys</span>, and <span title="filthy, slobbering people">slubberdegullions</span>. All these gave attention to the <span title="slight of hand tricks">prestigiations</span> of a <span title="magical and miraculous">thaumaturgical</span> <span title="ventriloquist">engastrimuth</span> and <span title="fortune-teller interpreting ground markings">geomancer</span>. He made the <span title="positively asserting">asseveratory</span> declaration that he could give <span title="visual">ocular</span> <span title="full demonstration">apodixis</span> that he possessed complete cognition of <span title="fortune telling using the markings of the forehead">metoposcopy</span>, <span title="interior eye inspection">ophthalmoscopy</span>, <span title="fortune telling using markings on the hand">chiromancy</span>, <span title="searching for underground water using a dowsing rod">rhabdomancy</span>, <span title="fortune telling using small bones or dice">astragalomancy</span>, <span title="fortune telling using numbers">arithmancy</span>, <span title="fortune telling using smoke rising from a fire">capnomancy</span>, and <span title="fortune telling using letters of a name">onomancy</span>. He <span title="asserted">averred</span> that he was <span title="a skilled">an adept</span> <span title="interpreter of dreams">oneirocritic</span>, <span title="knife swallower">cultrivorist</span>, and <span title="rope walker">funambulist</span>.

        <p>The <span title="fortune telling">ariolation</span> and <span title="unfolding">recluding</span> of the future terrestrial allotments of the <span title="crowds">congeries</span> that <span title="surrounded">environed</span> this <span title="falsely-all-knowing">pseudo-omniscious</span> <span title="narrator of wonderful things">mirabilary</span>, <span title="caused">effectuated</span> singular phases in their <span title="faces">phizes</span>. Those who, by a <span title="looking">spectation</span> either into <span title="watery">aqueous</span> liquids, or upon the <span title="knots">nodosities</span> of a <span title="rod">caduceus</span> or upon the <span title="wrinkles">corrugations</span> of their <span title="hand">mannal</span> extremities, or by any other media of <span title="foretelling">auguration</span> or <span title="prophecy">vaticination</span>, were favored with a perception of their future <span title="happiness">beatitude</span>, became <span title="leaping">salient</span> with <span title="delight">delectation</span>, and emitted the most <span title="noisy">obstreperous</span> <span title="hysterical laughter">cachinnations</span>; whilst others, beholding either their proximity to the <span title="admitting no return">irremeable</span> <span title="boundary">bourne</span>, or much <span title="bitterness">amaritude</span> <span title="mixed">immixed</span> with the evolutions of the filaments of their <span title="earthly">sublunary</span> <span title="life">vitality</span>, became quite <span title="deeply thoughtful">cogitabund</span>, <span title="melancholic">atrabilarian</span>, <span title="complaining">querimonious</span>, pessimistic, and <span title="worsened">exacerbated</span>.

        <p>Leaving the <span title="prophetic">fatiloquent</span> <span title="surpriser">flabbergaster</span> and his <span title="tricked victims">dupes</span>, and <span title="desiring">desiderating</span> the deletion of <span title="ignorance">nescience</span>, as also the <span title="filling">impletion</span> of my <span title="money">nummular</span> <span title="purse">crumenal</span> with <span title="money">rhino</span>, whilst <span title="passing the winter">hiemating</span>, - for, as you know, <span title="without money all is vain">"absque argento omnia vano"</span> - I decided to demonstrate my <span title="aptitude for teaching">didacticity</span> by becoming a <span title="preparative">propaedeutical</span> <span title="schoolmaster">domine</span>; and hence, I entered into a <span title="reciprocal">synallagmatic</span> <span title="contract">astipulation</span> as <span title="countryside">rural</span> <span title="teacher">pedagogue</span>. So soon as the <span title="necessary">requisite</span> <span title="signatures">subsignations</span> could be secured to the <span title="double">bipartite</span> <span title="wage-receiving">stipendiary</span> <span title="writing signed by both parties to a contract">syngraph</span>, I entered the <span title="schoolhouse">phrontistery</span>, and assumed <span title="teaching">paideutical</span> and <span title="useful teaching">chrestomathic</span> functions.

        <p>About the time of my becoming an <span title="instructing">erudiating</span> <span title="educator">literator</span> of frontier <span title="children">bairns</span>, I resorted to <span title="a shady">an umbratical</span> <span title="camping">castrametation</span> containing <span title="many">multitudinous</span> <span title="listeners">audients</span>; addressed by a <span title="preacher">homilist</span>. The <span title="dry">sere</span> autumnal season; the dense <span title="gloomy">tenebrious</span> <span title="shade">umbrosity</span> of the <span title="small brush">bushet</span>; and the <span title="important">moliminous</span> occasion of the <span title="bringing together">comportation</span>, were <span title="tending">conducent</span> to the <span title="rousing">exsuscitation</span> of <span title="strict devotion">pietism</span>, or <span title="funereal">epicedian</span> emotions. The <span title="deportment">abearance</span>, <span title="appearance">ostent</span>, and <span title="facial">physiognomical</span> aspects of the <span title="preachers">ecclesiasts</span> present, furnished a <span title="strengthening">roboration</span> of the already generated <span title="solemnity">saturnity</span>.

        <p>The <span title="former part">anteriority</span> of the officiating <span title="preacher's">homilist's</span> existence had been rather <span title="winding">sinuous</span> and <span title="changeful">protean</span>. His <span title="youthfulness">juvenility</span> had been <span title="stained">maculated</span> with many vicious, <span title="worthless">triobolary</span> <span title="excesses">extravagations</span> and <span title="wicked">nefandous</span> abominations. At the termination of his adolescence, he became a <span title="scoundrel">fustilarian</span>, a <span title="sponge">scambler</span>, a <span title="teacher">literator</span>, <span title="a surveyor">an arpentator</span>, <span title="a razor grinder">an acutiator</span>, a <span title="watch repairer">horologist</span>, and <span title="a wanderer of everywhere">an omnivagant</span> under the profession of <span title="specialist in foot care">chiropodist</span>, <span title="underground water detector">bletonist</span>, and <span title="metalworking">vulcanian</span> journeyman. By an <span title="obscure">esoteric</span> and imaginary <span title="heavenly">supernal</span> influence, he was speedily transformed into an <span title="inspired">entheastic</span> <span title="sentimental religionist">pietist</span>; and he transferred the <span title="keen insight">acumen</span> of his mental vision from secular and <span title="earthly">terrene</span> objects, into cryptic and <span title="deep learned">acroamatical</span> parts of the <span title="saintly writings">hagiography</span>. <span title="Filled">Surcharged</span> with <span title="obsession for books">bibliomania</span>, he was <span title="inclined">propense</span> to <span title="fortune telling by books">bibliomancy</span>. He was a thorough <span title="faith believing">solifidian</span> <span title="opposer of baptism">catabaptist</span> and <span title="grave and gloomy person">saturnist</span>; and I may <span title="add">adject</span>, a mere <span title="pretender in theology">theologaster</span>, - an <span title="experimenting">empirical</span> <span title="peculiar">idiopathic</span> <span title="selfish person">suist</span>. His <span title="sacred treatise">hierology</span> was on the <span title="approach">appropinquation</span> of the <span title="millenarian">chiliastic</span> <span title="conflagration">empyrosis</span> of this <span title="earth">mundane oblate spheroid</span>, or <span title="great world">macrocosm</span>, based on the <span title="prophetic">fatidical</span> parts of the <span title="sacred writings">hierography</span>.

        <p>His <span title="manner">farrand</span> of <span title="address">allocution</span> was <span title="unique">sui generis</span>.

        <p>Not withstanding his boasted <span title="education late in life">opsimathy</span>, the illiteracy and <span title="rudeness">inurbanity</span> of the <span title="previous">precedaneous</span> part of his life was very <span title="translucent">tralucent</span>. His intonations were <span title="sorrowful">dolorous</span>, and in the mobility of his <span title="body">corporeity</span> he resembled a <span title="rope walker">funambulist</span>. In his <span title="style of speaking">elocution</span>, his vocal powers ascended from an almost inaudible <span title="whisper">susurration</span> to <span title="croaking">crocitation</span>, and from <span title="croaking">crocitation</span> to <span title="bad sounding">cacophonic</span> <span title="crying out">vociferation</span> as made him <span title="drool">dreul</span>, and was <span title="powerful">puissant</span> enough to <span title="tear into pieces">laniate</span> his <span title="throat">guttural orifice</span>. His <span title="voice lowering">cadences</span> terminated in mere <span title="harsh">raucous</span> <span title="whispers">susurrations</span>. His <span title="faulty">defectuous</span> <span title="imitation">mimesis</span> of Whitefield was quite perceptible. In his <span title="explanation">eclaircissement</span> of the <span title="prophetic">vaticinal</span> portion of the <span title="saintly writings">hagiography</span> in relation, <span title="regarding the end of the world">eschatologically</span>, - to the <span title="millennial">chiliastic</span> finale of this <span title="earthly">mundane</span> structure, he made certain occurrences chronologically synchronous, or <span title="at the same time">equitemporaneous</span>, which <span title="interpreters">glossologists</span> and authentic <span title="authorities on history">historiographers</span> greatly <span title="taken away">eloigned</span> from each other. In his <span title="computations">epilogisms</span> in relation to <span title="prophetic">fatidical</span> events, he <span title="showed">evinced</span> <span title="a contempt">an aspernation</span> of all <span title="insertions into a calendar">embolisms</span>.

        <p>He gave <span title="a mystically interpretative">an anagogical</span>, <span title="imaginary">chimerical</span>, and <span title="incomprehensible">acataleptic</span> interpretation to prophetical icons, which all <span title="mental">noetic</span> <span title="explainers">elucidators</span> have <span title="pondered">perpended</span> as literal. In <span title="truth">verity</span>, his <span title="heretical">cacodoxical</span> <span title="sacred treatise">hierology</span> was so <span title="full">replete</span> with <span title="windings and turnings">anfractuosities</span>, <span title="fantastically falsified">pseudological</span> <span title="mistakes">fallencies</span>, <span title="datings of events before they happened">prochronisms</span>, <span title="equalities in duration">isochronisms</span>, <span title="datings of events after they happened">parachronisms</span>, and <span title="incorrect reasonings">illogicalities</span>, that the entirety of the matter became <span title="doubted">dubitable</span>, <span title="having two meanings">ancipitable</span>, and quite <span title="nonsensical">amphigorical</span> to me, notwithstanding the fact his sapient <span title="winkings">connictations</span> in the formation of his <span title="pedantic adherences to rules">ergoisms</span>, seemed to exhibit his <span title="full persuasion of confidence">plerophory</span> of assurance that the proximity of the <span title="conflagration">empyrosis</span> was no longer a <span title="state of being doubtful">dubiosity</span>, or <span title="thought unifying">syncretistical</span> <span title="irreconcilable problem">quodlibet</span>. His <span title="encouraging">parenetical</span> <span title="summing up">epilogation</span>, seized the <span title="credulity">cullibility</span> of his <span title="uneducated">atechnic</span> <span title="listeners">audients</span>, and greatly <span title="aroused">exagitated</span>.

        <p>The <span title="high level ground">plateau</span> of <span title="encampment">castrametation</span> was <span title="fivefold">quinquepartite</span>. The one <span title="regarding">anent</span>, or <span title="in front of">paravant</span> the <span title="pulpit">ambo, or rostrum</span>, having a <span title="partition">sepiment</span> for <span title="separation">demarcation</span>, had a <span title="straw-like">stramineous</span> or <span title="chaff-like">festucous</span> surface for the occupancy of the <span title="follower">sequents</span> and <span title="seekers">questants</span>. In <span title="nearness">juxtaposition</span> to this, were dualistic departments for the <span title="courteous">gent</span>, <span title="respectable">farant</span>, and <span title="sophisticated">debonair</span> <span title="hearers">auditors</span>. Posterior to these, were the <span title="two-sexed">bisexous</span>, <span title="noisy crowd of low people">rabblement</span>, or <span title="common people">plebeiance</span>. The male department of the latter was <span title="full">fraught</span> with - <span title="scoundrels">faitours</span>, <span title="insignificant fellows">fopdoodles</span>, <span title="tramps">boolies</span>, <span title="mean fellows">louts</span>, <span title="flatterers">claw backs</span>, <span title="dancers">kickshoes</span>, <span title="fops">petitmaitres</span>, <span title="rag tags">ragabashes</span>, <span title="dissolutes">rakehells</span>, <span title="impertinents">rampallians</span>, <span title="half wits">bumpkins</span>, <span title="upstarts">jackanapes</span>, <span title="revelers">wassailers</span>, and <span title="fools">nincompoops</span>.

        <p>The feminine department was stocked with <span title="coquettes">jilts</span>, <span title="flirts">flirtigigs</span>, <span title="gadders">fizzigs</span>, <span title="servants">malkins</span>, <span title="foppish girls">mauthers</span>, <span title="fast girls">modders</span>, <span title="flatterers">tomrips</span>, <span title="possibly unchaste women">demireps</span>, <span title="sycophants">flibbergibs</span>, and <span title="awkwardly tall women">gammerstangs</span>.

        <p>The occupants of these two departments mutually <span title="winked">nictitated</span> at their <span title="sweetheart">lemen</span>, and exhibited the most <span title="scornful">derisory</span> <span title="behavior">deport</span> towards the <span title="preacher">homilist</span>. Indeed, the <span title="merriment">jouissance</span>, <span title="conversation">enterparlance</span>, and <span title="unruliness">effrenation</span> of this <span title="crowd">posse</span> were a great <span title="most important point">crux</span> to the <span title="near">proximate</span> <span title="listeners">audients</span>. At this <span title="unemotional">apathistical</span> <span title="crowd">posse</span>, the <span title="all around seeing">periscopic</span>, <span title="sharp eyed">argus eyed</span> <span title="preacher">preachman</span> made <span title="very powerful">prepotent</span> <span title="effort">conatus</span>.

        <p>Although in this <span title="introductory">isagogical</span> part of his discourse, he <span title="denied">disclaimed</span> even a <span title="wish not strong enough to lead to action">velleity</span> towards <span title="strife">decertation</span> with any of his <span title="contemporary fellows">cotemporaries</span>, yet he <span title="chided">delitigated</span> <span title="the doctrine that matter is God">Hylotheism</span>, <span title="Islam">Islamism</span>, and <span title="Catholicism">Papism</span>; and <span title="rebuked">increpated</span> <span title="image worshipers">iconolaters</span>.

        <p>His <span title="intense feelings">fervency</span> became apparent in his <span title="enumeration of parts">aparithmesis</span>, and as he approximated the <span title="final speech">epilogue</span>, or <span title="encouraging">parenetical</span> part, and <span title="striking conclusion">epiphonema</span> of his <span title="sermon">homily</span>.

        <p>His <span title="exhortation">parenesis</span> was <span title="ardent">calid</span>. I will append to the <span title="foregoing">antecedent</span> <span title="description">portraiture</span> an <span title="extract">excerpt</span> from my <span title="proposed route of travel">itinerary</span> as noted down by me <span title="by shorthand">brachygraphically</span>.

        <p>My dear <span title="disciples">sectators</span>: - I <span title="beg">implore</span> you to cherish <span title="right feeling">eupathy</span>, and a <span title="full">plenary</span> <span title="enjoyment">fructure</span> of religion. <span title="Obey">Morigerate</span> no longer your <span title="inborn">ingenerate</span> <span title="wicked">malign</span> <span title="inclinations">propensions</span>. Enter upon <span title="capacity for religious affections">theopathy</span>, and <span title="deny">abnegate</span> your <span title="worldliness">mundanity and secularity</span>. You can yet have a <span title="foretaste">pregustation</span>, yea, a <span title="tasting beforehand">prelibation</span> of a better existence.

        <p>O ye <span title="unemotional">apathistical</span> <span title="lukewarm people in religion">laodiceans</span>! Soon, - it may be <span title="of the present day">hodiurnal</span>, - your <span title="soul and body conflict">psychomachy</span> will terminate and your <span title="faith">foy</span> be <span title="transformed">transmuted</span> into fruition. <span title="Avoid">Evitate</span> all <span title="fashionableness">alamodality</span> and <span title="backsliding">recidivation</span>; and to this end, <span title="search out">indagate</span> the <span title="saintly writing">hagiography</span> with <span title="unwavering">perseverant</span> <span title="continuousness">incessancy</span> in relation to the <span title="truth">verity</span> of these announcements. <span title="Distinguish">Secern</span> yourselves from all <span title="ridiculous">ludibrious</span> <span title="crowds of common people">rabblements</span>, and seek <span title="heavenly">supersecular</span> <span title="unfading">indefectible</span> treasures. Have your <span title="open lamps">cressets</span> and <span title="flaming torches">flambeaus</span> <span title="brightly">luminously</span> <span title="burning">flagrant</span>, and <span title="avoid">evitate</span> <span title="carelessness">invigilance</span>. But O, ye <span title="evil doers">fatours</span>, sycophantic parasites, and <span title="sycophants">flibbergibs</span>; ye <span title="dirty">sterquilinous</span> <span title="lewd fellows">rakehells</span>, <span title="mean wretches">rampallians</span>, <span title="drunkards">wassailers</span>, <span title="flirts">flirtigigs</span>, and <span title="possibly unchaste women">demireps</span>! What <span title="inciting">hortation</span> shall I impart to you? You all lie under divine <span title="curses">execration</span>, and your <span title="belo stars">subastral</span> existence is truly <span title="on trial">probationary</span> and <span title="temporary">temporaneous</span>. Divest yourselves of your <span title="lack of goodness">imbonity</span>, <span title="religious indifference">adiaphorism</span>, <span title="thoughtlessness">incognitancy</span>, and <span title="bad conduct">malversation</span>. <span title="Goodness">Bonity</span> is <span title="obtained by petition">impetrable</span>. <span title="Consider">Perpend</span> your <span title="great distance">longinquity</span> from <span title="good feeling">eupathy</span>, and <span title="unable to be narrated">inenarrable</span> sequences of your <span title="unreadiness">impreparation</span> from the <span title="approaching">approprinquating</span> <span title="sudden calamity">catastrophe</span>.

        <p>O, ye <span title="arrogant">supercilious</span> <span title="dandies">petit-maitres</span>! <span title="Tread on">Conculcate</span> the <span title="glittering">fulgid</span> <span title="ornaments">ornature</span> of your persons, and suppress your <span title="futilities">nugacities</span>, and <span title="foolish talk">stultiloquy</span>. Ye <span title="dancers">kickshoes</span>! <span title="Stop">Cease</span> your <span title="dances">tripudiations</span>. Ye <span title="drunkards">wassailers</span>! <span title="Strike out">Elide</span> your <span title="bottles">costrels</span>, and <span title="deny">denegate</span> yourselves of your <span title="drunkenness">vinolency</span>, and <span title="lying">cretan</span> practices. Ye <span title="gaily dressed dandies">modders</span>, and <span title="insignificant fellows">fopdoodles</span>; and ye <span title="glittery">clinquant</span> flirts! <span title="Cast off">Abject</span> your <span title="shining">elamping</span>, <span title="silken">bombycinous</span> <span title="clothing">habiliments</span>, and your <span title="trinkets">bijoutry</span>, and cease your irrational <span title="hair curlings">calamistrations</span>. And O, ye <span title="greedy">covetous</span> and <span title="fraudulent">covinous</span> hunks! Ye <span title="Earthborn">terrigenous</span> <span title="tribe">sept</span>! Desist from your <span title="needless">supervacaneous</span> toil and <span title="feelings of irritability">disquietudes</span>.

        <p><span title="Come">Accede</span> ye all into the <span title="straw-like">stramineous</span> department <span title="opposite">paravant</span> the <span title="pulpit">rostrum</span>. <span title="Bend inwards">Incurvate</span> your <span title="knee joints">poplitics</span>, and perform <span title="kneeling">genuflection</span>. <span title="Beseech">Obsecrate</span> that you may <span title="obtain by prayer">impetrate</span> a <span title="cleansing">purgation</span> from all your <span title="wicked">nefandous</span> <span title="offenses that require expiation">piacles</span> and <span title="disgusting acts">abominations</span>, and become <span title="sin free">impeccable</span>. If you refuse to come, you will be in a <span title="trial">periclitation</span> to suffer <span title="unreturnable">irremeable</span> <span title="banishment">relegation</span> to the <span title="fearfully dark">cimmerian</span> <span title="underworld">inframundane</span> <span title="infernal">Stygian</span> and <span title="gloomy">Acherontic</span> regions of <span title="Hell">Abaddon</span>, where your <span title="devout wishes">apprecations</span> and <span title="cries for help">quiritations</span> will be <span title="useless">frustraneous</span>, and horrendous <span title="brimstone">sulphureous</span> <span title="flames">flagrations</span> will <span title="roll and whirl">circumgyrate</span> about you, and <span title="unending">interminable</span> <span title="remorse">remordency</span> will <span title="torment">excruciate</span> you <span title="eternally">sempiternally</span>.

        <p>At this <span title="critical moment in time">juncture</span>, the <span title="inflow">influx</span> into the <span title="chaffy">paleous</span> department became ample and rapid. <span title="Outcries">Conclamations</span>, <span title="crying">lachrymations</span>, and <span title="noisy">perstreperous</span> <span title="bellowings">boations</span> became apparently, <span title="everywhere at once">ubiquitous and omnipresential</span>. The <span title="confused mixture">synchysis</span>, <span title="uproar">durdum</span>, and <span title="agitation">quassation</span> of the <span title="congregation">synaxis</span> were, according to my standard of religious <span title="articles of faith">credenda</span>, very <span title="discordant">absonant</span>, and <span title="out of place">malapropos</span>, and <span title="therefore">ergo</span>, I made my exit.

        <p><span title="Following this">Subsequently</span>, I enjoyed <span title="eating together">commensation</span> with this <span title="preacher">concionator</span> at a <span title="self-indulgent">sybaritic</span> <span title="feast">fete</span>, where he <span title="showed">envinced</span> himself an expert <span title="anatomist of birds">ornithotomist</span>, and a <span title="learned">sapient</span> <span title="master of the art of dining">deipnosophist</span> and <span title="extensively learned">cyclopedic</span> <span title="scientist of diet">sitiologist</span>, but indicated his <span title="undeprived">undivested</span> <span title="bondage">thralldom</span> to <span title="the art of preparing and eating good food">gastronomy</span>.

        <p><span title="Consider">Deeming</span> this a <span title="sufficiency">suffisance</span> of my <span title="mysterious">arcane</span> <span title="high-sounding language">bombastry</span> for the present,

        <p>I am,
        Most <span title="friendly">amicably</span> and <span title="compliantly">subserviently</span>,

        <p>Most <span title="Self-taught">Autodidactic</span> and <span title="School Teaching">Pedagogical</span> Sir: -

        <p>As my vocabulary of <span title="pretentious">lexiphanic</span> and <span title="long">sesquipedal</span> <span title="words with multiple syllables">polysyllabicities</span> is not yet exhausted, I again <span title="dip">merge</span> my <span title="feathery">plumous</span> <span title="tool">implement</span> of <span title="the art of writing">chirography</span> into <span title="inky">atramental</span> fluid for another <span title="pouring out">effusion</span> of <span title="letter-like">epistolary</span> <span title="inflated style of writing">fustian</span>.

        <p>A few fortnights <span title="before">prior to</span> the <span title="arrival">advent</span> of the <span title="winter">hiemal</span> season, I, in <span title="assocation">consociation</span> with Fritz, - a <span title="familiar">contubernial</span> <span title="good friend">belamy</span> of mine, returning from <span title="a between the mountains">an intermontane</span> <span title="hunting">venatory</span> excursion, <span title="caught sight">espied</span> in the <span title="neighborhood">convicinity</span> of <span title="a town">an oppidan</span> community, an ample concourse of the <span title="common people">populacy</span> in an <span title="undisguised">apert</span>, <span title="tall">procere</span>, and <span title="leafy">foliaceous</span> <span title="grove">firth</span>, giving <span title="attention">audition</span> to a political <span title="wise from age">nestorian</span> <span title="speech giver">sermocinator</span>.

        <p>He was <span title="wrinkled">rugose</span>, <span title="thick skinned">pachydermatous</span>, slightly <span title="blind">bisson</span>, <span title="short legged">breviped</span>, <span title="slow">tardigradous</span>, and affected with partial <span title="deafness">surdity</span>, <span title="dimness of sight">secutiency</span>, <span title="feebleness of age">caducity</span>, and perceptible <span title="peculiarity">seity</span>.

        <p><span title="Old words">Archaisms</span>, <span title="foreign words">exoticisms</span>, <span title="obsolete">exolete</span> and obsolescent lingo, and <span title="excessively devoted">fetishistic</span> <span title="super patriotism">chauvinism</span>, characterized his <span title="advisory speech">allocution</span> to the <span title="crowd">conflux</span>.

        <p>He located the <span title="preference">prelation</span> of himself to his competitors, upon the <span title="achievements">chevisances</span> of the <span title="former">antecedaneous</span> part of his existence; upon his <span title="knowledge">connusance</span> of <span title="financial">cameralistic</span>, <span title="studies of wealth">chrematistics</span>, and <span title="judicial law">jurisprudence</span>; upon his <span title="agreement">consension</span> with the primordial and immaculate democracy; and especially upon his <span title="deterioration due to age">senility</span> and <span title="far seeing">proleptical</span> <span title="recognition of a past mistake">resipiscence</span>.

        <p>In the enumeration of his <span title="achievements">chevisances</span>, he furnished <span title="a visual">an ocular</span> <span title="demonstration">apodixis</span>, that he was of <span title="an illustrious">a doughty</span> and <span title="noble">ethel</span> <span title="family">stirp</span>. His <span title="grandfather">ayle</span> and <span title="uncle">eame</span> had both been <span title="mighty in war">bellipotent</span>, and of his <span title="ancestors">progenitors</span> had been <span title="associate">consessor</span> with the <span title="lawgivers">thesmothetes</span> of our nation during the formation of the national <span title="political union">systasis</span>, and rendered much <span title="auxiliary">adminicular</span> service. He was himself a <span title="former">ci-devant</span> <span title="very brave">achillean</span> <span title="commander">cid</span>, or <span title="commander of many men">chiliarch</span> of a <span title="company of troops">vexillation</span>, and for many <span title="years">annuary epochs</span>, endured the <span title="harshness">durity</span> of <span title="army marching">agminal</span> <span title="encampment">castrametation</span>, and wielded the <span title="sword">bilbo</span> in <span title="many">multitudinous</span> <span title="resounding with arms">armisonous</span> <span title="battle">valkyrian</span> <span title="strifes">concertations</span>, upon <span title="blood-flowing">sanguifluous</span> <span title="battlefields">arenas</span>.

        <p>These things were not <span title="boastfully">thrasonically</span> spoken. He <span title="asserted">averred</span> that his <span title="knowledge">connusance</span> of <span title="finance">cameralistics</span> had been <span title="useful">utile</span> to the federal compact on various emergencies. He made the <span title="declaration">indiction</span> that an <span title="enlargement">ampliation</span> of the tariff upon <span title="foreign">forinsecal</span> commodities would induce remote <span title="governments">gubernations</span> to <span title="kickback">recalcitrate</span> by passing <span title="prohibitory">interdictory</span> laws in relation to us; and as a sequence, a <span title="cutting off">decurtation</span> of our <span title="foreign merchants">mercatantes</span> would occur.

        <p>His advocacy of a <span title="decrease">minoration</span> of the tariff upon <span title="foreign">forinsecal</span> <span title="merchandise">mercature</span> was <span title="very forcible">pancratic</span>. His <span title="agreement">consension</span> with the <span title="primeval">primevous</span> <span title="democracy">democraty</span>, and his <span title="hard earned experience">resipiscence</span> from adolescence to a great <span title="advance in age">provexity</span>, were very <span title="very clear">luculent</span>.

        <p>His <span title="main principles">principia</span> are:- The <span title="decrease">minoration</span> of all <span title="extravagances">extravagations</span> and <span title="high living">sumptuosities</span> in <span title="controlling">hegemonical</span> operations, especially the <span title="needless">supervacaneous</span> <span title="salaries">guerdons</span> of the <span title="governmental">gubernative</span> functionaries; the <span title="overthrow">eversion</span> of <span title="monied">pecunious</span> <span title="political clubs">synomosies</span>; the <span title="repeal">abrogation</span> of all the <span title="bad laws">dysnomies</span> of the present <span title="rulers">dynasts</span>; the <span title="stopping">cessation</span> of the <span title="trade">mercature</span> on <span title="borrowed">mutatious</span> media; the enactment of <span title="equal laws">isonomies</span>; the <span title="thrusting away">depulsion</span> of <span title="wickedness">vitiosity</span> in the <span title="lower">proletarian</span> ranks by the enactment of <span title="healthful">salutiferous</span> laws; the deletion of popular <span title="ignorance">inscience</span>, by the erection of <span title="schoolhouses">phrontisteries</span> of all gradations. In the inferior, or <span title="preparative">propaedeutical</span>, superior and ulterior of which should be taught, - <span title="good spelling">orthography</span>, <span title="the art of writing">chirography</span>, <span title="good pronunciation">orthoepy</span>, <span title="the philosophy of virtue">aretology</span>, <span title="the philosophy of what fundamentally exists">ontology</span>, <span title="the philosophy of human life">physianthropy</span>, <span title="the science of human passion">pathognomy</span>, <span title="the science of dining">aristology</span>, <span title="the science of eye diseases">ophthalmology</span>, <span title="the science of duty">deontology</span>, <span title="the science of earth formation">geogony</span>, geography, geology, <span title="the science of earth's structure">geognosy</span>, <span title="knowledge of the soil">geoscopy</span>, <span title="mineralogy">oryctognosy</span>, <span title="animal describing">zoography</span>, <span title="the science of rotary motion">trochilics</span>, taxidermy, <span title="the science of air">pneumatology</span>, <span title="the study of grasses">agrostology</span>, economics, <span title="the practice of distance measuring">longimetry</span>, hydrodynamics, <span title="the study of tribe customs">agriology</span>, gymnastics, psychology, <span title="the study of diets">dietetics</span>, <span title="the study of electrical phenomena in organisms">electro-biology</span>, and <span title="knowledge of the nature of man">anthroposophy</span>.

        <p>He <span title="repeated">iterated</span> the <span title="declaration">asseveration</span>, that he was not a <span title="seeker">questant</span> for a participation in the <span title="administration">guberance</span> of the federation in view of <span title="union">ditation</span>; but rather, from an irrepressible conviction that a mutation in the <span title="ruling">regnant</span> powers should take place; that the <span title="extravagances">extravagations</span> and <span title="bestowal of gifts">largitions</span> of the <span title="in office">incumbent</span> <span title="rulers">dynasts</span> have <span title="put into operation">effectuated</span> a <span title="weakening">labefaction</span> of former <span title="good laws">eutaxy</span>; that his former <span title="good natured patience">longanimity</span> was exhausted; that, though <span title="living a long time">longevous</span>, he had never, in any <span title="former part">anteriority</span> of his <span title="life below the stars">subcelestial</span> being, perceived such a <span title="need">necessitation</span> for a <span title="cutting short">decurtation</span> of national <span title="exceptions">fallencies</span> as in this present <span title="century">secle</span>. He made the indication, that the present <span title="bad laws">dysnomy</span> and aspect of the federation was most <span title="saddening">luctual</span> to him; and that, as a <span title="statesman">statist</span>, he had the most <span title="gloomy">sombre</span> <span title="forebodings">ominations</span> of disastrous sequences in view of the <span title="bad management">maladministration</span>, <span title="robberies">depeculations</span>, and <span title="treachery">proditions</span> of the <span title="governing">gubernative</span> party; that he had an insatiable <span title="craving">inhiation</span> to witness the <span title="restoration">reddition</span> and <span title="predominance">prepotency</span> of pure Washingtonian and Jeffersonian democracy, or <span title="mob rule">ochlocracy</span>; and never, <span title="government by the rich">plutocracy</span>.

        <p>In the <span title="previous">prevenient</span>, or <span title="introductory">prolegomenary</span> part of his <span title="speech">locution</span>, the orator at times <span title="spoke unintelligibly">haffled</span> somewhat, but he soon became <span title="pompous">grandiloquent</span>. His <span title="old age">senectitude</span>, and the <span title="traces">vestiges</span> of <span title="former">anterior</span> <span title="civility">debonairity</span>, furnished an <span title="excuse">essoin</span> for his frequent <span title="belches">eructations</span> and <span title="spittings">exspuitions</span>.

        <p>His <span title="closing speech">epilogue</span> was <span title="pithy">apothegmatical</span>, and abounded in <span title="lofty speaking">magniloquence</span>, <span title="eloquence">facundity</span>, <span title="severely critical">aristarchian</span> and <span title="caustic">escharotic</span> <span title="satirical writing">pasquinade</span>.

        <p>I will <span title="add">subjoin</span> a <span title="simplified">paraphrastical</span> version of it as <span title="shorthandedly">tachygraphically</span> jotted down in my <span title="notebook">adversaria</span>.

        <p>O, my <span title="fellow countrymen">compatriots</span> and my <span title="representative voters">constituency</span>! Do you not <span title="catch sight of">espy</span> a crisis in your <span title="below the stars">subastral</span> <span title="life">vitality</span>, in which you should <span title="dispel">depel</span> your <span title="deathly">lethal</span> <span title="thoughtlessness">incogitancy</span>, and <span title="think beforehand">precogitate</span> your <span title="voting by ballot">ballotation</span>? Remember you are <span title="possessing full power">plenipotent</span>, aye, <span title="having power to do many things">multipotent</span> to <span title="strangle">strangulate</span> the <span title="harmful">malign</span> <span title="habits">assuetudes</span> and <span title="abuses">abusions</span> of the <span title="in office">incumbent</span> <span title="rulers">dynasts</span>. <span title="Mighty in battle">Armipotent</span> to prevent a new <span title="group">bevy</span> of <span title="parasitic">parasitical</span> <span title="petty politicians">politicasters</span> to <span title="feast together">convive</span> upon you like so many <span title="bloodsuckers">sanguisuges</span> upon <span title="stupid animals">insensate quadrupeds</span>. My competitors are nothing but <span title="experimenting">empiric</span> <span title="advocates of new laws">neonomians</span>, <span title="amateurish">sciolistic</span> <span title="upstarts">parvenue</span>, <span title="moderns">neoterics</span>, <span title="blown up">inflated</span> <span title="beginners">neophytes</span> to their party, <span title="fops">jack-a-dandies</span>; <span title="fond of show making">ostentous</span>, and unwilling to <span title="labor">moile</span>. They are far more <span title="understanding">cognizant</span> and <span title="knowledgeable">scient</span> in <span title="dangling about women">cicisbeism</span> than in civil economics jurisprudence. Their <span title="chief aim">collimation</span> is to be the <span title="fashionable world">beau monde</span>, and <span title="fatten">saginate</span> their <span title="lean">macilent</span> <span title="little worlds">microcosms</span> on the <span title="tax">cess</span> of the <span title="people">leod</span>. They are mere <span title="dishonest">covinous</span> <span title="vulgar mouths">slang-whangers</span> and <span title="pleasers of the vulgar">skipkennels</span> to a radical <span title="faction">junto</span>; mere <span title="cunning">machiavellian</span> <span title="statesmen">wealsmen</span>, whose <span title="speeches">sermocinations</span> are nothing but <span title="flattery">blandiloquence</span> and <span title="alluring">illecebrous</span> <span title="leading of common people">demagogism</span>.

        <p>They are as <span title="foolish">inane</span> of true <span title="citizenship">civism</span> as the Russian <span title="absolute ruler">autocrat</span> is of <span title="riffraff">canaille</span>. I <span title="entreat">obtestate</span> you, my senile and junior <span title="democrats">democratists</span>, to <span title="renew">redintegrate</span> the <span title="contest">dimication</span> for the <span title="overthrow">eversion</span> of radicalism, and for the rehabilitation of <span title="primordial">primordiate</span> <span title="general equality">omniparity</span> in the republic. Recall to your <span title="remembrance">souvenance</span> the <span title="promises">pollicitations</span> of the present <span title="rulers">regents</span> and their entire <span title="emptiness">inanity</span>. Would you not rather be under a <span title="government by old men">gerontocracy</span>, a <span title="government of new officials">neocracy</span>, a <span title="government by the military">stratocracy</span>, a <span title="government where all rule equally">pantisocracy</span>, or even a <span title="government by women">gynecocracy</span>, than under <span title="flattering">glavering</span> radicalism and republican <span title="government ruled by honor">timocracy</span>? I conjure you to be <span title="hustlers">thoroughstitches</span> in your <span title="resistance">colluctancy</span> to radical <span title="subjection">dition</span>. I <span title="beseech">obsecrate</span> you to <span title="throw aside">abject</span> your <span title="before now">antecedaneous</span> <span title="sluggishness">segnitude</span>; to <span title="naturalize">indenizen</span> the aliens, and be <span title="on the move">movent</span>.

        <p>Let the <span title="standard bearers">vexillaries</span> <span title="go before">antecede</span> the <span title="walking">gradient</span> column with <span title="flying">flotant</span> <span title="banners">vexils</span> inscribed with - "<span title="GOOD LAWS">EUNOMY</span> AND <span title="GENERAL EQUALITY">OMNIPARITY</span>!"

        <p>Let all the <span title="voters">suffragists</span> <span title="advance">advene</span> to the arena of <span title="voting by ballot">ballotation</span> for the <span title="snatching away">ereption</span> of the <span title="security">munities</span> of the <span title="majority">plurality</span> from the <span title="abuses">abusions</span> and <span title="treachery">proditions</span> of the <span title="in office">incumbent</span> <span title="rich governors">plutocrats</span>.

        <p>Let the radicals <span title="tremble with fear">quassate</span> like Belshazzar, and realize <span title="ubiquitous">ubiquitary</span> <span title="deprivation of authority">exauctoration</span>, <span title="rejection">extraversion</span>, <span title="political banishment">ostracism</span> and <span title="public disgrace">atimy</span>!

        <p>This <span title="exhortation">peroration</span> made the whole <span title="assembly">contesseration</span> <span title="excited">animose</span>, and <span title="brought forth">elicited</span> an <span title="applause">euge</span> <span title="powerful">potent</span> enough to <span title="rend">lacerate</span> one's <span title="ear drums">auricular avenues</span>.

        <p>The political <span title="assembly">comportation</span> then <span title="dispersed">disbanded</span>.

        <p>At this point, Fritz, - my chum, - encountered the <span title="address">compellation</span> of an <span title="officer">apparitor</span> with a <span title="writ of arrest">capias</span> or <span title="summons">interpellation</span> for him to appear at the <span title="next">proxime</span> <span title="court of justice">judicatory</span> to give <span title="answer">responsion</span> to certain <span title="criminal charges">allegata</span> <span title="made known">divulgated</span> by a certain <span title="ranchman">ranchero</span>, <span title="accuser">delator</span>.

        <p>He <span title="charged">delated</span> Fritz of <span title="secret">clancular</span> <span title="taking away">depulsion</span>, <span title="driving away">ablastion</span>, <span title="shipping">deportation</span> and <span title="selling">vendition</span> of <span title="black cattle">rotherbeasts</span>. This seemed to <span title="affect">impinge</span> Fritz like <span title="thunder">fulmination</span> and <span title="lightning">fulguration</span>; and at first, greatly <span title="saddened">tristitiated</span> him. In a <span title="foreign">peregrine</span> land, without many <span title="good friends">belamies</span>, he was in great <span title="depression">prosternation</span> relative to his situation. He however, found a <span title="bondsman">mainpernor</span>. The day of <span title="thorough investigation">pervestigation</span>, - <span title="court day">dies juridicus</span> - soon arrived. Fritz, being <span title="a stranger">an alien</span>, <span title="unknown">unkent</span>, with limited <span title="monetary">pecuniary</span> resources, a <span title="lawyer">leguleian</span> became the <span title="voluntary">ultroneous</span> <span title="defender">susceptor</span> of his cause.

        <p>This <span title="bodily">somatic</span> physique was <span title="tall">procere</span> and <span title="handsome">beauteous</span>, and his <span title="manner">ostent</span>, <span title="cultured">debonair</span>. <span title="Widely knowledgeable">Multiscious</span> in <span title="frivolous litigation">vitilitigation</span> and <span title="the study of truth">alethiology</span>; <span title="perceiving everything">omnipercipient</span>, <span title="all-wise">pansophical</span>, <span title="narrowly examining">emissitious</span>, and observant with <span title="the study of human nature">anthroposcopy</span>, <span title="the study of human character from faces">metoposcopy</span>, and <span title="logical reasoning">dialectics</span>. Without <span title="doubt">dubitancy</span>, he was <span title="an expert">a dabster</span>, a <span title="lover of truth">philalethist</span>, <span title="an extensively learned">a cyclopedic</span> <span title="person who discusses any subject at pleasure">quodlibetarian</span>, and <span title="a member of supreme court">an areopagist</span>.

        <p>His <span title="reply">responsion</span> to <span title="introductory">isagogical</span> speech of the <span title="little headed">microcephalous</span> <span title="lawyer">jurist</span> for the <span title="plaintiff">regime</span>, was <span title="in accord">consentaneous</span> with true <span title="pleading">placitory</span> dialectics, and was such a <span title="powerful">pancratic</span> <span title="making void">cassation</span> of the <span title="false reasonings">paralogy</span> of his <span title="contradicter">antiloquist</span>, that all <span title="suspense">pendency</span> relative to Fritz's being a <span title="thief">larcener</span> was <span title="put out">douted</span>.

        <p>The <span title="legal expert">jurist</span> for the <span title="state">polity</span> was a mere <span title="quackish">charlatanical</span> <span title="buyer of lawsuits">champertor</span>. His <span title="ghastly">cadaverous</span>, <span title="wrinkled">rugose</span>, <span title="unnatural">cataphysical</span>, and <span title="warty">verrucose</span> <span title="face">phiz</span>; his <span title="flattened">camoused</span> <span title="nose">olfactor</span>; his <span title="swollen out">extuberant</span> <span title="lips">labials</span>; his <span title="long-headed">dolichocephalous</span>, <span title="curly">cirrigerous</span>, somewhat <span title="frizzy">ulotrichous</span>, <span title="ill shaped">informous</span> <span title="head">noll</span>; his <span title="near sightedness">myopy</span> and <span title="squinting">strabism</span>; his <span title="toothless">edentated</span>, <span title="tobacco-like">nicotian</span> <span title="mouth">moe</span>; his <span title="long jawed">macrognathic</span>, <span title="bearded">barbigerous</span> <span title="jaw">mazard</span>; his <span title="lean">macilent</span> <span title="body">corporeity</span>; the <span title="thinness">exility</span> and <span title="leanness">marcidity</span> of his <span title="long legs">macropodous locomotives</span>; all <span title="showed beforehand">premonstrated</span> his <span title="stupidity">hebetude</span>, and was <span title="fundamental">axiomatic</span> evidence that he was not even a <span title="mediocre person">mediocrist</span>, but a mere <span title="unlearned">inerudite</span>, <span title="not technically skilled">atechnic</span>, <span title="meddlesome">polypragmatic</span> <span title="wrangler">hafter</span> and <span title="stubborn">pervicacious</span> <span title="strife maker">barrator</span>. His <span title="ignorance">inscience</span> of <span title="ancestral">avital</span> <span title="court proceedings">justicements</span>, and <span title="study of truth">alethiology</span>, and his <span title="overuse of words">perissology</span> and his <span title="repetition of words">battology</span> imparted to his <span title="handling of the subject">tractation</span> of his cause <span title="a vagueness">an imperspicuity</span> which rendered it <span title="unimportant">immomentous</span> to his <span title="jury">juratory audients</span>.

        <p>The <span title="speech introduction">catastasis</span>, or <span title="introductory">preludious</span> part of his <span title="opening">apertion</span> of the <span title="accusation">accrimination</span> was <span title="circuitous">ambagitory</span>, and <span title="far fetched">catachrestical</span>. His <span title="inability">incapacity</span> was <span title="self-evidently">apodeictically</span> conspicuous in the <span title="bringing forward">adduction</span>, <span title="administering oaths">adjuration</span>, and <span title="questioning">sciscitation</span> of these <span title="false witnesses">pseudo testificators</span>.

        <p>They were a <span title="lying">mendacious</span> <span title="clique">clan</span>, and their <span title="presentations of testimony">testifications</span> were very <span title="inharmonious">absonous</span>, and devoid of all <span title="joint attestations">comprobations</span>. In <span title="truth">verity</span>, the <span title="lying">mendacity</span> of some of the <span title="testifiers">testificators</span> was so <span title="clear">diaphanous</span> that Fritz's <span title="defender">propugnor</span> obtained from the <span title="judge">domesman</span>, or <span title="justice of the peace">eirenarch</span>, the right of <span title="verification of oaths">compurgation</span>, by the <span title="bringing forward">adduction</span> of <span title="supplemental">adscititious</span> evidence relative to some of them as <span title="witnesses">deponents</span>. In this <span title="bringing forth">adduction</span> of <span title="aiding">adminicular</span> testimony, no <span title="persons swearing to veracity of others">compurgator</span> appeared. In the final <span title="half">mediety</span> of his <span title="speech">locution</span>, there was no <span title="connection">concatenation</span> of <span title="strengthening">roborant</span> circumstances, but a mere <span title="patchwork">consarcination</span> of <span title="imaginary">commentitious</span> <span title="accusations">allegata</span>, which could never constitute a <span title="trifle">miniment</span> of any <span title="wicked">nefandous</span> <span title="offense that requires expiation">piacle</span> or <span title="disregard of law">anomy</span> in Fritz.

        <p>After many <span title="needless">supervacaneous</span> <span title="repetitions">iterations</span> of mere <span title="nonsense">fingle-fangle</span>, he <span title="began">commenced</span> to <span title="flatter">supparasite</span> the <span title="jury">juratory bevy</span> relative to their <span title="intellectual">noetical</span> <span title="qualification">habilitation</span> to <span title="sift out">sarse</span> Fritz's <span title="evil doing">maleficence</span>, and <span title="decide judicially">adjudicate</span> to <span title="send">ablegate</span> him to a <span title="prison">lobspound</span>, and have him there <span title="walled in">immured</span> and securely <span title="locked up">obserated</span>; or <span title="impose a fine on">mulct</span> him to such a <span title="monetary">pecuniary</span> amount as to make the <span title="obtaining">adeption</span> of the <span title="guarantor">fidejussor</span> <span title="unworkable">impracticable</span>; thereby effecting his <span title="banishment">expulsion</span> from the <span title="neighborhood">convicinity</span>.

        <p>Thus he <span title="wasted time">dawdled</span>; and such was his <span title="stupidity">insulsity</span>, <span title="nonsense">morology</span>, <span title="unsophisticatedness">jejunity</span>, and the <span title="cloudiness">nebulosity</span> of his <span title="brains">harns</span>, that he could not perceive the <span title="mocking">derisive</span> <span title="deriding">ludification</span> of his <span title="hearers">audients</span>.

        <p>He seemed to be <span title="unfriendly">inimicitious</span> and <span title="embittered">acerb</span> towards Fritz in his <span title="rural">agrestic</span> <span title="dress">russet</span>, through mere <span title="judging character from external appearance">prosopolepsy</span>.

        <p>The <span title="reply">replication</span> of Fritz's <span title="attorney">legist</span> to this <span title="banter">badinage</span>, notwithstanding his <span title="few words">pauciloquy</span>, was <span title="overpowering">anatreptic</span>, <span title="refuting">elenctical</span>, <span title="very forceful">prepotent</span>, and <span title="full of">replete with</span> the most <span title="caustic">pyrotic</span> <span title="satirical writing">pasquinade</span>. He <span title="made clear">eclaircised</span> all the <span title="knotty">nodose</span> aspects in the <span title="criminal accusation">accrimination</span>, and <span title="showed">evinced</span> Fritz's <span title="dove-like">columbine</span> <span title="innocence">innocency</span>; that the <span title="accuser's">delator's</span> <span title="witnesses">testificators</span> were a most <span title="untruthful">mendacious</span> <span title="lying">cretan</span> <span title="clan">sept</span>; that the <span title="accusation">delation</span> contained <span title="an abundance">a plenitude</span> of <span title="falsehoods">pseudologies</span> and <span title="slanders">maledicencies</span>; and that the <span title="plaintiff">querent</span> was an egotistical <span title="learned fool">morosoph</span>, and <span title="apathetic">dedolent</span> <span title="criminal">scelerat</span>; prompted wholly in the <span title="accusation">delation</span> by an <span title="invincible">indomitable</span> <span title="hatred for mankind">misanthropy</span> and <span title="hatred of culture">philistinism</span>; and that he was entitled to a <span title="nothingness">nihility</span>, or <span title="state of being nowhere">nullibiety</span>. In <span title="truth">verity</span>, that the entire procedure was illegal; and that, from <span title="things previously known">praecognita</span>, and precedence he demanded not only an <span title="absolving">absolutory</span> <span title="judgement of not guilty">acquittal</span>, an <span title="unforced">unextorted</span> <span title="setting free">assoilzie</span> and <span title="clearing oneself">deraignment</span>. Not only so, but a considerable <span title="monetary">pecuniary</span> <span title="indemnification for injury">assythment</span>, as Fritz's absolute, and <span title="just and natural">jural</span> <span title="right">droit</span>.

        <p>The <span title="decision">arbitrament</span>, or <span title="verdict">adjudication</span> of the <span title="court">judicature</span> was <span title="useful">proficuous</span> to Fritz. In a jiffy, the whole <span title="assembly">comportation</span> emitted into the aerial vault the most <span title="outcrying">conclamatory</span> and congratulatory <span title="bellowing">boations</span>, and <span title="poured out">effunded</span> upon the <span title="ranchman">ranchero</span> the <span title="excessively plentiful">plethoric</span> <span title="abundance">cornucopia</span> of their <span title="anger">ire</span>. The <span title="revisers">redacteurs</span> and <span title="journalists">diurnalists</span> gave Fritz's arraignment and <span title="trial">adjudication</span>, <span title="publishing">divulgation</span> and <span title="divulging">evulgation</span>; which invested him with <span title="very important">moliminous</span> and <span title="indestructible">imperdible</span> <span title="notoriety">famosity</span>.

        <p>More <span title="quickly">anon</span>.

        <h3>February 19, 1873</h3>

        <p>Most <span title="skillful in writing">scribatious</span> and <span title="unselfish">altruistic</span> Sir:-

        <p>Being again moved with something like <span title="an itch for writing">cacoethes scribendi</span>, I call into <span title="order">requisition</span> my <span title="writing desk">escritorial</span> <span title="materials">furnishments</span> to <span title="precisely outline">delineate</span> for you, <span title="in all minor details">in minutiae</span>, my experience at a <span title="luxurious">sybaritic</span> <span title="marriage">nuptial</span> <span title="buffet">ambigu</span>, and the <span title="accompanying">concomitant</span> <span title="important">momentous</span> <span title="results">sequences</span>.

        <p>Fritz and I returning from a negotiatory trip to the <span title="western">hesperian</span> <span title="main city">megalopolis</span>, arrived, in the <span title="afternoon">post-meridian</span> part of the day, in a <span title="neighborhood">visne</span>.

        <p>Having <span title="approached">approximated</span> a <span title="lodging house">hostelry</span> of <span title="impressive">imposing</span> and <span title="pleasing">delectable</span> appearance, we discovered that every <span title="accompanying thing">concomitant</span> of the establishment was undergoing a general <span title="purification">depuration</span>. All the <span title="odd-job assistants">factotums</span> about the <span title="fine farm">hacienda</span> were <span title="diligently">sedulously</span> employed. I made a <span title="cautious">circumspective</span> <span title="gradually progressing">pedetentous</span> <span title="surveying">reconnoitering</span> tour of inspection to the <span title="rear">posterior</span> department of the <span title="building">extruction</span>, where I <span title="caught sight of">espied</span> the most <span title="bloody">sanguinary</span> scenes. There took place the <span title="killing">trucidation</span> of <span title="birds">pennigerous bipeds</span> by <span title="beheading">decollation</span>; of <span title="calf-like">vituline</span>, <span title="sheep-like">ovine</span>, <span title="curly tailed">curvicaudate</span>, <span title="pig-like">suilline, or porcine</span>, and other <span title="hairy">crinigerous</span> and <span title="woolly">lanigerous</span> <span title="four legged animals">quadrupeds</span>, by the <span title="drawing out">exantlation</span> of their <span title="blood">sanguineous fluid</span>. Some of the <span title="feathered">plumigerous</span> and <span title="winged">aligerous</span> <span title="two footed animals">bipeds</span> were undergoing <span title="plucking">deplumation</span> or deprivation of their <span title="coverings">indument</span> by <span title="plucking">decerption</span>.

        <p>Some of the <span title="bristly">strigillose</span> and <span title="hairy">piligerous</span> <span title="four footed creatures">quadrupeds</span> were in a process of <span title="skinning">excoriation</span>, and others subject to a <span title="hair removal process">depilatory eventeration</span>, and <span title="weighing">trutination, or ponderation</span>.

        <p>The <span title="nearness">propinquity</span> of these operations to my visual powers, <span title="evoked">evocated</span> in me the conviction that <span title="a feast">an epulation</span> was <span title="near at hand">approximating</span>; and being somewhat <span title="thorough">scrutinous</span> and inquisitive, I received <span title="awareness">cognoscence</span> that on the <span title="next">proximate</span> day a <span title="wedding">sponsal</span> <span title="feast">epulation</span> was to occur.

        <p>In <span title="casual conversation">confabulation</span> with the <span title="talkative">homiletical</span> and <span title="welcoming">hospitable</span> host <span title="prior">antecedent</span> to <span title="late evening reception">couchee</span>, Fritz and he produced, in the progress of their <span title="conversation">enterparlance</span>, mutual and <span title="undoubted">indubious</span> <span title="family descending">genealogical</span> <span title="proof">apodixis</span>, that they stood in relation of cater cousins to each other. In consequence of his great seniority to Fritz, and his early <span title="moving out">emigration</span> from home, they had <span title="prior">anterior</span> to that evening been in a state of <span title="ignorance">nescience</span> to each other.

        <p>Our <span title="agreeableness">concinnity</span> of <span title="manners">abearance</span>, and his great <span title="civility">comity</span> and <span title="hospitality">xenodochy</span>, as well as his <span title="same-bloodedness">consanguinity</span> to Fritz <span title="brought forth">educed</span> from him an invitation to us to participate in the <span title="merriment">hilarity</span> of the approaching <span title="wedding">nuptials</span>.

        <p>The parties to be concatenated were his senior daughter and a <span title="country-born">rurigenous</span> <span title="gentleman">gent</span> <span title="village">visne</span>.

        <p>On the <span title="wedding">nuptial</span> day, at the <span title="hourly">horal</span> designation, the guests arrived at the mansion, in <span title="wagons">wains</span>, <span title="buggies">curricles</span>, and other <span title="vehicular">vehiculary</span> <span title="conveyances">voiture</span>; upon <span title="saddle horses">montures</span>, <span title="ordinary horses">yawds</span>, <span title="jades">plugs</span>, <span title="Mexican ponies">bronchos</span>, <span title="donkeys">burros</span>, and <span title="horse">equine</span> <span title="crosses">hybrids</span> with abnormally <span title="lengthened">elongated</span> <span title="ears">auricular appendages</span>. There were, also, <span title="many">multitudinous</span> <span title="walkers">pedestrians</span>.

        <p>The <span title="junior">puisne</span> folk of both genders exhibited themselves in the <span title="best state">optimity</span> of their attire.

        <p>Ultimately the <span title="preacher">ecclesiastic</span> who was to <span title="bind">colligate</span> the parties <span title="lasting">indissoluble</span> <span title="binding marriage tie">conjugium</span> with the <span title="unbreakable">infrangible</span> <span title="shackles">gyves</span> of <span title="the god of marriage">Hymen</span>, arrived.

        <p>He was <span title="between 80 and 89 years old">octogenarian</span>. His <span title="dark">sable</span> <span title="clothes">envelopes</span>; his <span title="mournful">lugubrious</span> <span title="appearance">countenance</span>; the <span title="wrinkledness">rugosity</span> of his <span title="face">visnomy</span>; his <span title="bald">depilous</span> cranium; the <span title="roundness">rotundity</span> of his person; the <span title="graceful slenderness">gracility</span> of his <span title="legs">crural organs</span>; and his <span title="flask shaped">ampulliform</span> <span title="nose">olfactor</span>, engaged my <span title="eyes">optics</span> exceedingly.

        <p>He <span title="united">coalesced</span> the interests of the <span title="loving">amorous</span> pair by <span title="Roman marriage ceremony">confarreation</span>, and immediately after the <span title="marriage">espousals</span>, <span title="resounding">anacamtic</span> <span title="bell ringings">tintinnabulations</span> from the <span title="communal dining room">refectory department</span>, anounced a change in the programme. In a <span title="shortness">brevity</span> of time, the doors of the <span title="dining room">refectory</span> were made <span title="open">patulous</span>, and the <span title="table">mensal</span> board <span title="loaded">onerated</span> with <span title="various foods">prog</span>, <span title="delicacies">cates</span>, <span title="sweetmeats">succades</span>, and in <span title="truth">verity</span> <span title="an excess">a superabundance</span> of <span title="various">omnifarious</span> <span title="edible">cibarious</span> <span title="foods">comestibles</span>, displayed itself to dazzled eyes and <span title="inclined to eat">esurient</span> <span title="mouths">maws</span>. This <span title="table">mensal structure</span> was soon <span title="surrounded">environed</span> by <span title="churls">carls</span>, <span title="clowns">chuffs</span>, <span title="blockheads">clodpates</span>, <span title="clumsy fellows">clumps</span>, <span title="deceivers">coggers</span>, <span title="carefree men">galliards</span>, <span title="ranchmen">rancheros</span>, <span title="herdsmen">vaqueros</span>, <span title="bull fighters">tauromachians</span>, <span title="rude girls">hoidens</span>, <span title="misers">hunks</span>, <span title="simpletons">noodles</span>, <span title="talkative">dicacious</span> <span title="city women">citesses</span>, <span title="lady's waiting-maids">abigails</span>, <span title="townsmen">oppidans</span>, <span title="country folks">rustics</span>, <span title="modest">verecundious</span> <span title="handsome girls">bonnibels</span>, <span title="beautiful girls">bonnilasses</span>, <span title="flower adorned">floricomous</span> <span title="fair lasses">whiting-mops</span>, <span title="officious people">pickthanks</span>, <span title="cowards">poltroons</span>, <span title="roving people">rantipoles</span>, <span title="agriculturists">terraculturists</span>, <span title="upstarts">skipjacks</span>, <span title="drunkards">tosspots</span>, <span title="beauties">senoritas</span>, <span title="intellectual women">bas bleus</span>, and <span title="blushing">erubescent</span> misses of <span title="indescribable">ineffable</span> <span title="beauty">pulchritude</span>.

        <p>So soon as a <span title="solemn supplication">rogation</span> for a <span title="blessing">benison</span> by the <span title="preacher">concionator</span>, <span title="came to be known">transpired</span>, <span title="table forks">fourchette</span>, and all implements for the transportation of <span title="various food">prog</span> from the table to <span title="mouths">oral apertures</span>, were <span title="on the move">movent</span> and <span title="producing sound">sonorific</span>. Such <span title="prodigal expense of food">abligurition</span>; such <span title="wolfish">lycanthropic</span> <span title="greediness">edacity</span>, <span title="gluttony">lurcation</span>, <span title="greedy swallowing">ingurgitation</span> and <span title="greediness">gulosity</span>; such <span title="eating of anything">omnivorousness</span> and <span title="eating of everything">pantophagy</span>; and such a <span title="change">mutation</span> and <span title="flying away">avolation</span> of <span title="foods">comestibles</span>, had never fallen under my vision in any <span title="prior">antecedent</span> part of my <span title="life beneath the moon">sublunary entity</span>. Truly, <span title="reminiscent">anamnestic</span> of Byron's <span title="O, ye 'tough insides' of reapers!">"dura illia messorum!"</span>

        <p>The <span title="bean-like">fabaceous</span> and other <span title="edible">esculent</span> supplies had undergone thorough <span title="boiling">elixation</span>. The <span title="fine wine">supernaculum</span> and other <span title="fit for drink">poculent</span> liquids had been well <span title="sweetened">edulcorated</span>. The <span title="hashes">gallimaufries</span>, <span title="hodgepodge">olla podrida</span>, <span title="meat vegetable stews">ragouts</span>, and <span title="potpourri">salmagundi</span>, were all well <span title="preserved">condited</span>, and were <span title="delightful">delectable</span>; giving quite <span title="a keenness">an acuity</span> to the <span title="appetite">gusto</span> of the eaters.

        <p>After the <span title="stomachs">epigastrics</span> of all had been duly <span title="fed beyond desire">sated</span>, and the <span title="things belonging">appurtenances</span> of the <span title="table">mensal</span> board had been removed, <span title="a marriage song">an epithalamium</span> and other <span title="musical pieces written for a solo voice with orchestral accompaniment in an opera or cantata">ariettas</span> and <span title="little songs">chansonnettes</span> were chanted by the junior portion of the <span title="drunkards">convivialists</span>. This part of the programme was unceremoniously interrupted by <span title="a very noisy">an uproarious</span> <span title="riotous parade-like">callithumpian</span> <span title="mock serenade">charivari</span> by an <span title="hodgepodge">omnium-gatherum</span> <span title="crowd of common people">rabblement</span> of the <span title="surrounding districts">vicinage</span>.

        <p>We all then took <span title="sitting together">consession</span> in a spacious <span title="hall-like">aularian</span> saloon. Fritz and I were soon the <span title="centers of attention">cynosures</span> and objects of their <span title="suggestive glances">oeillades</span>, as <span title="foreign">peregrine</span> aliens in their midst. I saw them <span title="wink">nictate</span> and <span title="whisper">susurrate</span>, and they seemed much <span title="amused">titillated</span> at our <span title="recent">neoteric</span> appearance among them. We, however, disregarded their <span title="foolish">abderian</span> <span title="gigglings">ludifications</span>. When the parson had withdrawn, they <span title="began">inchoated</span> <span title="dancing">saltation</span>, which some performed with considerable <span title="nimbleness">legerity</span>; especially, the <span title="leader of the dance">presultor</span>.

        <p>Those of the feminine gender, appeared in the <span title="best state">optimity</span> of their attractions. The <span title="wigs">tetes</span> of some had undergone much unique and artistic <span title="frizzing">capillature</span>; and the <span title="head">capital</span> <span title="hairy">crinitory</span> <span title="fibres">filaments</span> of others had been so <span title="curled">crispated</span> by the instruments of <span title="barber">tonsorial</span> <span title="hairdressers">friseurs</span>, as to resemble the <span title="winding">spiral</span> <span title="curls">flexures</span> of the <span title="tail">caudal extremity</span> of a <span title="pig">porcine quadruped</span>. Their <span title="hats">chapeaus</span> were gorgeously <span title="adorned with bright feathers">plumed</span>, and <span title="exaggerated">hyperbolically</span> and <span title="brilliantly">fulgidly</span> <span title="ornamented">ornated</span>. Their <span title="silky">sericeous</span> <span title="handkerchiefs">fazzolets</span> and <span title="silky">bombycinous</span> <span title="handkerchiefs">mokadours</span> were brilliant and highly <span title="odorous">odorated</span>. Their faces had been <span title="marked with red">rubricated</span> and <span title="stained">infucated</span> with <span title="paint">fucus</span>. Indeed they exhibited such flirtation that almost affected me with <span title="women hatred">misogyny</span>.

        <p>Fritz and I <span title="entertained">exhilarated</span> a knot of guests with <span title="entrancing">orphean</span> <span title="music portions">strains</span> upon the <span title="jew's harp">guimbard</span>; and with <span title="clever remarks">bon mots</span>, quips, and <span title="puzzles with language encoded as pictures">rebuses</span>; and rendered other <span title="assistance">auxiliations</span>, to the best of our <span title="peculiar qualifications">appropriaments</span>; but we did not <span title="dance">tripudiate</span>, or participate in any <span title="senseless talk">gallimatias</span>.

        <p>When all had received <span title="satisfaction">satiation</span> as to the <span title="varied">diversified</span> amusements, especially, <span title="dancing-related">terpsichorean</span> indulgence, the <span title="ingroup">coterie</span> disbanded. At one time, all were hugely <span title="shaken up">conquassated</span> by the diffusion of some <span title="powdered">pulverized</span> <span title="stinking tobacco">mundungus</span> on the floor.

        <p>I indulged in a <span title="continuance">permansion</span> with Fritz's <span title="genial">complaisant</span> and <span title="hospitable">harberous</span> <span title="kinsman">german</span> for the <span title="long duration">diuturnity</span> of a fortnight.

        <p>During this <span title="delay">tarriance</span>, I witnessed much of a very <span title="significant">momentous</span> <span title="importance">import</span>.

        <p>The <span title="excess">nimiety</span> and <span title="overfeeding">superalimentation</span> of <span title="various">multifarious</span> <span title="food-related">cibarious</span> substances engorged into <span title="empty">inane</span> and <span title="lacking nutritive value">jejune</span> stomachs during the <span title="marital">nuptial</span> festivity, were extremely <span title="disease producing">nosopoetic</span>, and some of the guests were ferried, - <span title="willing or unwilling">nolens volens</span>, - by <span title="the ferryman at the river Styx">Charon</span>, over the <span title="river in the lower world">river Styx</span>.

        <p>The <span title="disease causing">morbific</span> character of the <span title="diseases">maladies</span> became manifest variously in their physical organization. Some were seized with <span title="a headache from an overloaded stomach">deuteropathy</span>; some with <span title="nightmare">ephialtes</span>; others with <span title="indigestion">apepsy</span>, <span title="vomiting">emesis</span>, <span title="migraine">megrim</span>, <span title="nosebleed">epistaxis</span>, or <span title="bloody">sanguineous</span> <span title="flowing outs">manations</span> from their <span title="nostrils">nasal orifices</span>; some were affected with <span title="gum">gingival</span> and <span title="liver">hepatical</span> <span title="swelling">intumescence</span> and <span title="soreness of eyes">lippitude</span>; others were beset with <span title="a trance-like state with loss of voluntary motion and failure to react to stimuli">catalepsy</span>, <span title="sudden">subitaneous</span> <span title="fainting">lipothymy</span>, succeeded by <span title="jerking">subsultory</span> <span title="agitations">exagitations</span>; in others were generated <span title="difficulty with respiration">dyspnoea</span>, <span title="difficulty with swallowing">aglutition</span>, <span title="expanding">distension</span> of the <span title="membrane surrounding the heart">pericardium</span> and <span title="inflammation of the lungs">pneumonia</span>, induced by <span title="dancing">saltation</span> and <span title="breathing in">inhalation</span> of <span title="powdered">pulverized</span> <span title="tobacco">nicotian</span>.

        <p>Couriers were <span title="sent on a special mission">ablegated</span> from all parts of the <span title="village">villatic</span> community to secure <span title="supports">adjuments</span> of the <span title="medicine sellers">pharmacopolists</span>, <span title="surgeons">chirurgeons</span>, physicians, and even <span title="the choice of taking all offered or nothing">Hobson's choice</span> <span title="quacks">charlatans</span> and <span title="those without method">amethodists</span>.

        <p>In their <span title="diagnoses">diagnostications</span> and <span title="predictions">prognostications</span>, and their discovering <span title="exciting">procatarctic</span> causes, and prescribing, there was no <span title="similarity">consimilitude</span>. Not all of them were professionally versed and skilled in <span title="pharmacology">materia medica</span>, and the medical and surgical departments of <span title="the science of diseases">pathology</span>; - <span title="the science of disease causes">nosology</span>, <span title="the science of disease causes">aetiology</span>, morbid anatomy, <span title="the science of symptoms">symptomatology</span>, and therapeutics; and as a sequence, some of them shot wide of the mark as to <span title="human passion science">pathognomic</span> symptoms.

        <p>When I brought my <span title="inquiring">zetetic</span> <span title="healing">Aesculapian</span> battery to bear upon one of them, I discovered he could not differentiate among <span title="diseases">maladies</span> - <span title="wide spreading">epidemic</span>, <span title="locally spreading">endemic</span>, and <span title="irregularly spreading">sporadic</span>; infectious and contagious.

        <p>The one who officiated in the vicinity of the <span title="fine farm">hacienda</span>, imparted the following <span title="prescriptions">pharmaceutical recipes</span>:-

        <p>For <span title="migraine">megrim</span> and <span title="soreness of the eyes">lippitude</span>, - <span title="acupuncture">acupuncturation</span>, and <span title="scarring">scarification</span> on the <span title="skin">cutaneous</span> <span title="covering">integument</span> of the <span title="head">cranium</span>; for <span title="fainting">lipothymy</span>, the <span title="passing out">extravasation</span> of the <span title="ruby red">rubric</span> fluid by <span title="vein cutting">venesection</span>, or <span title="surgical incision into the vein">phlebotomy</span>; for <span title="leaping">subsultory</span> <span title="agitations">exagitations</span>, a <span title="sweat-related">sudatory</span> <span title="perspiration producers">diaphoretics</span>, and <span title="sleep producers">hypnotics</span>; for <span title="nose bleeding">nasal hemorrhage</span>, <span title="astringent drugs">styptics</span> applied to the <span title="nasal">rhinal</span> <span title="organ that carries off waste matter">emunctory</span>; for <span title="abscesses">imposthumations</span>, - <span title="clayey">argillaceous</span> <span title="smearing of the body">illutations</span>; for <span title="the nightmare">ephialtes</span>, <span title="indigestion">apepsy</span>, and <span title="headache from an overloaded stomach">deuteropathy</span>, - <span title="medicines against nightmares">antephialtics</span>, <span title="skin rubbing acupuncture">Baunscheidtism</span>, and <span title="warming">calefacient</span> <span title="blistering plasters">sinapisms</span>; for <span title="ilium and bowel related">iliac</span> <span title="feelings of irritability">disquietudes</span>, - <span title="strong old beer">stingo</span> <span title="mixed">immixed</span> with ginger and cayenne pepper; for <span title="inability to swallow">aglutition, or dysphagy</span>, - <span title="incision through the oesophagus">oesophagotomy</span>; for <span title="breathing difficulties">dyspnoea</span>, - <span title="incision through the windpipe">bronchotomy, or pharyngotomy</span>.

        <p>Should all these fail, or prove <span title="useless">inutile</span>, he insisted on an <span title="application">adhibition</span>, as a <span title="substitution medicine">succedaneum</span> and <span title="helping medicine">adjuvant</span>, of an <span title="infusion">apozem</span>, or <span title="boiling out">excoction</span> of <span title="ivy-like">hederaceous</span> and other <span title="roots">radicals</span> and <span title="barks">corticals</span>, which, <span title="cleansed">depurated</span> of <span title="dregs">lees</span> by <span title="filtering">percolation</span>, or <span title="straining">transcolation</span>, and well <span title="sweetened">dulcorated</span>, would lose its <span title="unpleasantness">injucundity</span> and become totally <span title="harmless">innocuous</span>. With this <span title="decoction-resembling">apozemical</span> treatment should be connected <span title="discharge promoting medicines">eccritics</span>, or drastic <span title="medicines opening body ducts">deobstruents</span> and <span title="medicines inducing vomiting">emetics</span>. <span title="Repetitions">Ingeminations</span> of very <span title="warming">calefacient</span> <span title="blistering plasters">epispastics</span>, and <span title="plentiful">copious</span> <span title="incision into a vein">phlebotomy</span> should be <span title="diligently">sedulously</span> <span title="drawn out">protracted</span> until the <span title="patient">invaletudinarian</span> became almost <span title="bloodless">exsanguinous</span> and <span title="faint">evanid</span>, anemic and <span title="deathlike">thanatoid</span> - <span title="seen with one's own eyes">autoptically</span> <span title="lifeless">exanimate</span>. Should a patient, from <span title="sweating">sudations</span>, <span title="bloodletting">venesections</span>, <span title="blisterings">vesicants</span>, and other <span title="skin">cutaneous</span> appliances, became <span title="sweltering">sweltry</span>, <span title="applications">adhibitions</span> of <span title="watery">aqueous</span> <span title="sprinklings">aspersions</span> upon the epidermis, should be <span title="diligently">sedulously</span> secured.

        <p>He <span title="asserted">asseverated</span> that these <span title="medicinal">medicamental</span> appliances would have the most <span title="health producing">salutiferous</span> syndrome; and that after <span title="a decrease">an imminution</span> of the patient's obesity by strict <span title="fasting">limotherapeia</span>, his <span title="cleansed">abstersed</span>, <span title="wasted away">emaciated</span>, and <span title="debilitated">adynamic</span> system might be <span title="restored">instaurated</span> with <span title="heart medicines">cardiacs</span> and <span title="digestive medicines">peptic sauces</span>. He <span title="repeated">iterated</span> the assertion that from the proficiency in <span title="the study of blood vessels and lymphatics">angiography</span>, <span title="the study of drug effects and mechanisms of action">pharmacodynamics</span>, <span title="the study of nutrition">threpsology</span>, <span title="the study of disease treatment">therapeutics</span>, and <span title="medicines which slow the course of an illness">prophylactics</span>, he knew the employment of this <span title="medicinal">medicamental</span> treatment would make <span title="restoration to health">sanation</span> certain.

        <p>He <span title="pledged">impignorated</span> his <span title="truthfulness">veracity</span> that the patient would be invested with an almost <span title="unfading">immarcescible</span> <span title="bloom">floriage</span>; and that, in his <span title="account">supputation</span> with them, he would not be <span title="conscientiously">scrupulously</span> exacting as to <span title="gainful">lucrific</span> <span title="reward">guerdon</span>. In <span title="polar">diametrical</span> <span title="opposition">oppugnancy</span> to his <span title="healing">Aesculapian</span> skill and the <span title="rectifying">remedial</span> treatment with <span title="universal remedies">diacatholicons</span>, <span title="medicines that have many uses">polychrests</span>, and <span title="neutral">adiaphorous</span> placebos, some of the <span title="diseases">maladies</span> were <span title="deadly">mortiferous</span>, and several of the <span title="younger">puisne</span> folks were soon <span title="incurably">irremediably</span> <span title="at death's door">moribund</span>, and made their exit for the <span title="returnless">irremeable</span> <span title="goal">bourne</span>, - <span title="The space through which souls pass to Hades">Erebus</span> and the realms of <span title="spirits">sprites</span>.

        <p>The <span title="quack's">amethodist's</span> <span title="drugs">medicamenta</span> were so <span title="stupor inducing">narcotic</span> and <span title="fatal">lethiferous</span>, that the victims of his <span title="clumsiness">indexterity</span>, in the <span title="finality">ultimity</span> of their <span title="life on Earth">terrestrial vitality</span>, were favoured with <span title="easy death">euthanasy</span>.

        <p>The <span title="merry-making">hilarity</span> of the <span title="marital">nuptial</span> <span title="feasting">epulation</span> merged into <span title="mournful">lugubrious</span> aspects. <span title="Splendid">Resplendent</span> <span title="attire">habiliments</span> were succeeded by <span title="jet black">sable</span> <span title="miscellaneous articles">paraphernalia</span> of <span title="funeral rites">obsequies</span>; and the <span title="musical composition based on religious texts">cantata</span> of <span title="joy">jovialities</span> were followed by <span title="funereal">exequial</span> <span title="feasts">arvals</span> and <span title="funereal">epicedian</span> <span title="songs">threnodes</span>. And O, the <span title="falling">cadent</span> <span title="tearful">lachrymary</span> <span title="outpourings">effusions</span> of the <span title="convulsed">clonic</span> and <span title="earnestly crying">clamant</span> <span title="crowd">ging</span>!

        <p>The <span title="doctor">medicus</span> <span title="mixed together">commingled</span> with the <span title="sighing">suspiring</span> <span title="mournful">threnetic</span> <span title="crowd">throng</span> in the <span title="march">procession</span> to the <span title="graveyard">necropolis</span> for the <span title="burial">inhumation</span> of the <span title="deceased people">decedents</span>; by notwithstanding his <span title="tearful">fletiferous</span> <span title="affected sorrow">crocodility</span>, he maintained the most astounding <span title="indifference">adiaphory</span> and <span title="calmness">ataraxy</span>.

        <p><span title="After">Subsequent to</span> the <span title="burial">sepelition</span> of the <span title="remains of the dead">reliquiae</span>, he exhibited his <span title="blank pieces of paper with signatures">carte blanche</span>, <span title="varied">variegated</span> with <span title="multiple">multitudinous</span> numerical <span title="additions">additaments</span>; - most <span title="by eyesight">ocularly</span> <span title="evident">indicant</span> of his <span title="profit seeking">questuary</span>, <span title="very desirous">covetous</span>, and <span title="deceitful">covinous</span> <span title="inclinations">proclivities</span>. After <span title="filling">impleting</span> his <span title="money purse">nummary receptacle</span>, he made his <span title="disappearance">disparition</span>.

        <h1>Letter VI,</h1>
        <h2>Mesquite <span title="Grove">Boscage</span>, <span title="West">Occident</span></h2>
        <h3>June 1, 1873</h3>

        <p>Most <span title="book loving">bibliophilistical</span> Sir:-

        <p>In the <span title="concluding part">finale</span> of my <span title="primary">primal</span> <span title="pretentious">lexiphanic</span> <span title="letter">epistolography</span>, I <span title="communicated">imparted</span> to you the <span title="truth">verity</span>, that <span title="womanliness">femininity</span> had not <span title="charmed">effascinated</span> me. Not so, however, as to my chum, Fritz. He does not believe that - <span title="to love and be wise is scarcely permitted even to a god">amare et sapere vix deo conceditur</span>; - and consequently, he is about to become a <span title="person recently married">neogamist</span>, by being <span title="bound">colligated</span> with <span title="marital">hymeneal</span> <span title="shackles">fetters</span>. He will doubtless soon be the <span title="blissful">beatific</span> occupant of his own <span title="fine farm">hacienda</span>, <span title="surrounded">environed</span> by the <span title="greatest">maximum</span> of <span title="paradise-like">paradisiacal</span> <span title="under the heaven">subcelestial</span> <span title="happiness">felicity</span>.

        <p>Without much <span title="indirectness">circuity</span>, I will give you the <span title="string">concatenation</span> of circumstances leading to the present status of his <span title="love making">amatorial</span> venture, - and <span title="in the first place">imprimis</span>, give you a <span title="brief">laconic</span> <span title="life history">biographic</span> sketch of Fritz.

        <p>He was, during his <span title="adolescence">adolescency</span>, a <span title="dweller by the sea">paralian</span>.

        <p>His ancestral <span title="occupancy">habitation</span> was <span title="neighboring">conterminous</span> to the <span title="maritime">maritimal</span> sections of this <span title="splendid">splendrous</span> columbian republic, where the <span title="denseness">congestion</span> of population and the <span title="highness">celsitude</span> of the means for the <span title="sustainment">sustentation</span> of <span title="life">vitality</span>, necessitated those who had, by <span title="extremely difficult">herculean</span> and invincible difficulties, become <span title="impoverished">depauperated</span>, to <span title="move out">emigrate</span> to the <span title="unoccupied">untenanted</span> portions of our <span title="western">occidental</span> domain.

        <p>Often he could not <span title="avoid">evitate</span> the <span title="discharge">emission</span> of the most grave <span title="sighs">suspirations</span> in view of the <span title="melancholic">atrabilarian</span> aspects of his <span title="native">natal</span> <span title="neighborhood">vicinity</span>, and of the <span title="ungovernable">unswayable</span> <span title="approach">approximation</span> of the <span title="twisting">detorsion</span> from the <span title="laborers">operatives</span>, of the media of obtaining a <span title="livelihood">competency</span>, by <span title="deluxe">opulent</span> <span title="companies controlling trade">monopolies</span>.

        <p>However <span title="thorough">sedulous</span> in any <span title="minor occupation">avocation</span>, but few could participate in the reception of correspondent <span title="financially rewarding">remunerative</span> <span title="recompense">guerdon</span>.

        <p>The <span title="unstopping">incessant</span> <span title="gradually and spontaneously growing">crescive</span> density of the <span title="beyond the mountains">transmontane</span> population <span title="forced">impelled</span> the <span title="owners">proprietors</span> of <span title="land">terra firma</span> to such constant <span title="repeated">ingeminate</span> <span title="ploughings">arations</span> and <span title="seed sowings">inseminations</span> of their <span title="farms">granges</span> for the <span title="drawing out">eduction</span> of <span title="rooty">radical</span>, <span title="herby">herbaceous</span>, <span title="pulsey">leguminous</span>, and <span title="wheaty and grainy">frumentarious</span> <span title="cereals">cerealia</span>, that <span title="earthy">terrene</span> <span title="barrenness">infecundity</span>, even of the most <span title="fertile">batful</span> soils, inevitably resulted.

        <p>Not only so, but the <span title="cutting up">discinding</span> of the <span title="farms">granges</span> into <span title="narrow">exiguous</span>, <span title="many cornered">multangular</span>, and <span title="many sided">multilateral</span> fragments, made them too <span title="narrow">angust</span> for occupancy. A mature <span title="deliberation">cogitation</span> upon the <span title="growing together">accreting</span> <span title="aggregations">congeries</span> of the <span title="inconveniences">discommodities</span> in prospect for his <span title="native">natal</span> land, brought him to the <span title="impulse to act">acturience</span> to <span title="effect">effectuate</span> a <span title="separation">segregation</span> of himself from the localities that witnessed the <span title="sportive pranks">gambols</span> of his <span title="youth">juvenility</span>, and <span title="acquire">procure</span> for himself a <span title="permanent residence">domiciliation</span> in the <span title="roomy">spacious</span> <span title="west">occident</span>. The announcement of his <span title="decision">illation</span> imparted a <span title="mournful">lugubrious</span> phase to the <span title="countenances">physiognomies</span> of his <span title="fatherly">paternal</span> and <span title="motherly">maternal</span>, or rather, - <span title="stepmotherly">novercal</span>, - relations; but <span title="illuminated">illumed</span> <span title="smiles">risibilities</span> upon the <span title="faces">phizes</span> of his enemies.

        <p>When the <span title="painful">doloriferous</span> moment arrived when his <span title="departure">discession</span> was to take its <span title="beginning">inception</span>, his <span title="cousins">germans</span>, <span title="paternal kinsmen">agnations</span> and <span title="maternal kinsmen">cognations</span>, in conjunction with many of his <span title="nearby">vicinal</span> <span title="contemporary fellows">cotemporaries</span>, congregated about him. His parents were <span title="strongly opposed">loth</span> to behold their entire <span title="bereavement">orbation</span>; and the rest, because his migration subjected them to the <span title="loss">amission</span> of an <span title="aiding">adjuvant</span> neighbor.

        <p>The <span title="decrees">edicts</span> of the <span title="destiny controllers">Fates</span> have been quite <span title="favorable">propitious</span> to him since his <span title="presence">ubiety</span> in the <span title="west">occident</span>.

        <p>A very <span title="wealthy">pecunious</span> <span title="blood related">consanguineal</span> <span title="uncle">avuncular</span> relative, - an <span title="unmarried person">agamist</span>, and a <span title="person between ninety and ninety-nine years old">nonagenarian</span>, - having terminated his <span title="life beneath the Sun">subsolar vitality</span>, <span title="willed">bequeathed</span> to Fritz all his <span title="earthly">terrestrial</span> <span title="possessions">acquisitions</span>. He also received his <span title="ancestral">patrimonial</span> <span title="inheritance">cleronomy</span>. The <span title="sum total">aggregate</span>, which was not inconsiderable, enabled him to effect the <span title="purchase">emption</span> of a <span title="fine farm">hacienda</span>.

        <p>The <span title="field like">campestral</span> and <span title="garden like">horticultural</span> enclosures are very <span title="abundantly producing">feracious</span> and <span title="fruitful">frugiferous</span>. The <span title="mansion">manse</span> is <span title="palace like">palatial</span>. The <span title="small farm">croft</span> is <span title="beautiful">venust</span> and attractive.

        <p><span title="Many-parted">Multifarious</span> and <span title="many-kinded">multigenerous</span> <span title="flower-bearing">floriferous</span>, <span title="nut-bearing">nuciferous</span>, <span title="apple-bearing">pomiferous</span>, <span title="pear-bearing">pyriferous</span>, <span title="plum-bearing">pruniferous</span>, and other <span title="fruit-bearing">fructiferous</span> trees and <span title="plants">plantage</span> are not <span title="wanting">minus</span>. Here he can, unannoyed by <span title="buzzing">bombylious</span> puncturing <span title="piercings">culices</span>, and other <span title="blood-eating">sanguivorous</span> <span title="leeches">sanguisuges</span> and <span title="small animals">animalculae</span>, indulge his <span title="inborn">ingenerate</span> <span title="sleepiness">somnolence</span>, and enjoy <span title="high quality">superlative</span> <span title="idleness">otiosity</span>, <span title="self-rulingly">autocratorically</span>.

        <p>The interior <span title="belongings">appurtenances</span> and <span title="decorations">garniture</span> of his <span title="dwelling">wone</span> is <span title="in unison">unisonous</span> with the exterior aspect, and this <span title="drew out">educed</span> from him the <span title="full persuasion">plerophory</span> that he was still under <span title="lack of furnishments">degarnishment</span> whilst <span title="lacking">minus</span> a <span title="housekeeper">femme d'charge</span>, and unassociated with one of the <span title="rib">costal</span> <span title="kind">genus</span>. His <span title="women fearing">gynephobia</span> <span title="lessened">minorated</span> most <span title="clearly">perceptibly</span>, and his <span title="desire">appetition</span> for the <span title="married">spousal</span> state became quite <span title="powerful">puissant</span>. His <span title="feelings of sexual desire">erotism</span> <span title="drove">impelled</span> him to frequent a <span title="fair-like">nundinal</span> occasion, where, <span title="perhaps">percase</span>, he ogled for the first time, at his prospective <span title="spouse">cara sposa</span>. He <span title="spotted">espied</span> her in <span title="association">consociation</span> with a <span title="law student">templar</span>, - a <span title="would be politician">politicaster</span>, - whose <span title="stupidity">fatuity</span> and <span title="little mindedness">parvanimity</span> was visible in all <span title="behavior">abearance</span>.

        <p><span title="An arrow-shaped">A sagittal</span> <span title="piercing">puncture</span> through his <span title="heart sac">pericardium</span> effected such a <span title="clearness">clarity</span> in his <span title="eyes">optics</span>, that he beheld a <span title="thousand">millenary</span> of charms in her <span title="beautiful">venust</span> physique. Her <span title="rosy">roseate</span> <span title="lips">labials</span>; her <span title="lily-like">liliaceous</span> <span title="skin">cuticle</span>; her graceful locomotive organs; and her <span title="flowing with honey">mellifluent</span> and <span title="sweetly speaking">suaviloquent</span> <span title="talkativeness">loquacity</span>, most <span title="dangerously">parlously</span> enamored him, and divested him of all <span title="self-sufficiency">autarchy</span>.

        <p>Having effected <span title="a mutual conversation">an enterparlance</span> with her, he found spontaneity of <span title="mutual conversation">interlocution</span> to be mutual; for the erotic <span title="crossbowman">arcubalister</span> had <span title="moved to action">actuated</span> his <span title="bent-cross bow">ballister</span> and <span title="hurled">jaculated</span> <span title="an arrow-like">a sagittary</span> <span title="arrow having rotary motion">vire</span> into her <span title="affections">cordialities</span> also; but the <span title="riddance">eviction</span> of the <span title="law student">templar</span> from her companionship was the <span title="point of exactness">punctilio</span> of his mental perturbations. The <span title="debatable point">quodlibet</span> induced upon him the most <span title="weakening">labefying</span> <span title="loss of appetite">anorexy</span> and <span title="love sickness">erotomy</span>; but having a <span title="foresight">prevision</span> that the <span title="petty politician's">politicaster's</span> <span title="politeness">debonairness</span> to her was rather impermanent, he brought him into <span title="contact">proximity</span> with a <span title="talkative">linguacious</span>, <span title="attractive">psychagogic</span> <span title="city lady">citess</span>, which effected a <span title="withdrawing">detraction</span> of all his <span title="former">antecedaneous</span> <span title="friendly civility">comity</span> to Miss Amenity. Having thus <span title="separated">segregated</span> the <span title="fop">macaroni</span> from her society, he - making me his <span title="confidant">privado</span>, and enlisting my auxiliary <span title="assistance">adjuvancy</span>, - dispatched to her a <span title="love letter">billet d'amour</span> somewhat after the following diction and <span title="manner of expression">phraseology</span>:-

        <p><span title="Most beloved">Alder-liefest</span> and most <span title="courteous">debonair</span> Miss; -

        <p><span title="Desiring">Desiderating</span> not to be <span title="circuitous">ambagitory</span> in the <span title="introductory">prolegomenary</span> part of this <span title="letter">epistle</span>, and <span title="omitting">waiving</span> all <span title="unnecessary">supervacaneous</span> apologies, I will announce to you that I have <span title="an inclination">a proclivity</span> to assume the <span title="married">marital</span> state, and that, since our recent <span title="face to face">tete a tete</span> <span title="conversation">interlocution</span>, I have <span title="fallen">delapsed</span> into a <span title="love">dilection</span> which has elicited this <span title="romantic">amatory</span> <span title="letter">epistolography</span> to you, and <span title="forced">extorted</span> the conviction that you are the <span title="rare person">rara avis</span> in <span title="companionship">consortion</span> with him the <span title="sweets">suavities</span> and <span title="bitters">amaritudes</span> of my <span title="beneath the stars">subastral</span> <span title="life">vitality</span> might be <span title="happily">felicitously</span> sustained. <span title="Therefore">Ergo</span>, my <span title="preference">prelation</span> of you, and my <span title="great desire">optation</span> to impart to you a <span title="definite">categorical</span> <span title="chain">catenation</span> of the <span title="prior requirements">prerequisites</span>, <span title="customs">assuetudes</span>, and <span title="habits">habilitations</span> of her in whose <span title="association">sodality</span> I am to <span title="extend">protract</span> my <span title="under the heavens">subcelestial</span> career in this <span title="rough">asperous</span> and <span title="cunning">subdolous</span> <span title="world">megacosm</span> to the time of my <span title="death">obit</span>.

        <p>Primarily, her physical structure must be <span title="of high stamina">staminal</span> and <span title="sound">sane</span>. She must not be a <span title="very small person">lilliputian</span>, nor of more than <span title="medium">medial</span> <span title="height">procerity</span>; neither <span title="bony">osseous</span>, nor encumbered with <span title="an excess">a superabundance</span> of <span title="fatty">adipous</span> tissue. Her physique must be <span title="beautiful">venust</span>, and her <span title="face">physiognomy</span> <span title="comely">bonny</span> and <span title="gleaming">nitid</span> as <span title="Venus">Phosphor</span> herself. Her articulations must be <span title="sweetly flowing">mellifluent</span> and <span title="nice sounding">euphonious</span> as those of the <span title="nightingale">rosignol</span>. Her <span title="walking">ambulations</span> must be <span title="quick">perk</span> and <span title="graceful">facile</span>. She must never use <span title="face paint">fucus</span> nor <span title="dress for show">prink</span>. She must <span title="beautify">adonize</span> herself but never envelope herself in <span title="downy">sericeous</span>, or <span title="silken">bombycinous</span> <span title="attire">habiliments</span> and glittering <span title="clothes">arraiment</span>, except on <span title="church">ecclesiastical</span>, <span title="fair-related">nundinal</span>, and <span title="holiday">ferial</span> occasions. She must not be <span title="going from house to house">circumforaneous</span>, nor <span title="talkative">multiloquous</span>; and never become a <span title="person who is curious to know everything going on">quidnunc</span>.

        <p>The <span title="avoidance">evitation</span> of <span title="soapy">saponaceous</span> <span title="cleansers">abstergents</span> and other <span title="cleansing">mundifying</span> media to <span title="avoid">obviate</span> <span title="bodily">somatic</span> <span title="offensive odor">fetidness</span>, and a premature <span title="wrinkled">rugose</span> <span title="face">phiz</span>, and apparent <span title="old-womanishness">anility</span>, must never <span title="characterize">denote</span> her. She must possess <span title="unending">interminable</span> <span title="good natured tolerance">longanimity</span>, and never affect any <span title="swooning">deliquium</span> in any <span title="sudden">subitaneous</span> fright. <span title="Smoking">Fumigation</span>, <span title="belching">ructation</span>, and immoderate <span title="hiccuping">yexing</span>, and <span title="yawning">oscitancy</span>, must not be indulged in, in my presence.

        <p>She must be skilled in <span title="housekeeping">domiculture</span>, and in such <span title="fortunetelling">hariolation</span> as <span title="divination by flowers">aleuromancy</span>, <span title="divination by mice">myomancy</span>, <span title="divination by fire">pyromancy</span>, <span title="divination by smoke">capnomancy</span>, and <span title="divination by mirrors">enoptomancy</span>; <span title="deft">dextrous</span> in <span title="the process of making bread">panification</span>, and in the preparation of <span title="many-kinded">polygenous</span> and <span title="many-formed">polymorphous</span> <span title="light meals">refections</span>; <span title="qualified">habile</span> in <span title="kneading">malaxation</span>, and the <span title="making">facture</span> of cakes of <span title="buckwheat">brank</span> and other <span title="cereals">cerealia</span>; <span title="skilled">adept</span> in the confection of <span title="delicacies">cates</span>, <span title="cheese cakes">juncates</span>, <span title="fine flour cakes">simnels</span>, <span title="sweetmeats">succades</span>, and in <span title="truth">verity</span>, <span title="knowing">scient</span> and <span title="skillful">perite</span> in the <span title="making">facture</span> of <span title="many-kinded">omnigenous</span> <span title="foods">comestibles</span> in the <span title="cooking">culinary</span> department. <span title="Also">Eke</span>, she must be well versed as to the chemical constituents of <span title="soapy">smegmatic</span> substances, and exhibit <span title="skillfulness">solertiousness</span> in manufacturing same; and at times operate the <span title="machine for forming threads">filatory</span>. She must not be unduly affected with <span title="fondness for flowers">anthomania</span>, but instead, occupy her leisure time in <span title="patchwork">interbastation</span>; and be not too <span title="proud">orgillous</span> to <span title="oversee">superintend</span> the incubation of <span title="fowl-like">gallinaceous</span> <span title="birds which are able to run about and obtain their own food as soon as hatched">autophagi</span>, and impart to their <span title="downy">lanuginous</span> and <span title="noisy">vociferous</span> <span title="offspring">progeny</span> <span title="abundant">ample</span> <span title="fattening">saginating</span> <span title="nourishment">nutrication</span>.

I am favorable to a <span title="joint rule">synarchy</span> or a <span title="system with two rulers">diarchy</span>, but <span title="directly">diametrically</span> <span title="opposed">contrariant</span> and <span title="combating">antagonistic</span> to all <span title="female ruling">gynecocracy</span>.

        <p>In <span title="conclusion">perclose</span>, if you can <span title="make return for">reciprocate</span> the <span title="right feeling">eupathy</span> which <span title="drew out">elicited</span> <span title="romantic">amatory</span> <span title="letter-like">epistolographical</span> <span title="outpouring">effusion</span>, a favorable <span title="reply">replication</span> will most <span title="truly">veritably</span>, invest me with <span title="unable to be narrated">inenarrable</span> <span title="delight">delectation</span>.

        <p>With <span title="measureless">metreless</span> <span title="love">amity</span>,
        Most <span title="passionately loving">erotically</span>, yours,
        Fritz.

        <p>A response, as follows, was <span title="granted">accorded</span>.

        <p>Most <span title="persuasive">suasory</span> Sir:-

        <p>I am the <span title="receiver">accipient</span> of your most <span title="unexpected">inopinate</span> complimentary <span title="passionately loving">erotic</span> <span title="letter">epistle</span>.

        <p><span title="After">Posterior to</span> a careful <span title="reading">lection</span> and <span title="consideration">perpension</span> of its <span title="important">momental</span> <span title="significance">import</span>, which greatly perturbed my <span title="usual">accustomary</span> <span title="sleepiness">somnolence</span>, I know, having my medium <span title="tranquility">serenitude</span>, <span title="briskly">alacriously</span> impart to you a response.

        <p>I am still <span title="unmarried">celibate</span>, though having arrived at the age of <span title="womanhood">muliebrity</span>, and hence, <span title="suitable for marriage">nubile</span> for several <span title="years">annuary epochs</span>. I have had <span title="countless">multitudinous</span> <span title="enticements">allectations</span> to enter into a <span title="married">maritated</span> state, but I have, as yet, <span title="avoided">evitated</span> all <span title="biting">morsure</span> at the <span title="allurements">inescations</span> coming from your gender: and all <span title="traps">illaqueations</span>, and all <span title="alluring">illecebrous</span> <span title="betrothal gifts">subarrations</span> from <span title="crowd pleasing">ad captandum</span> <span title="lovers">amorosos</span>. Whatever might <span title="happen">evene</span>, I have been <span title="prepared for action">procinct</span> against a <span title="falling down">procidence</span> to a state of deterioration by an <span title="unable to be violated">infrangible</span> <span title="fellowship">consortion</span> with <span title="fellows that dangle about females">petit-maitres</span>, or <span title="fops">jackanapes</span> in <span title="glittering">fulgid</span> <span title="decoration">ornature</span>, and <span title="exaggerated">hyperbolical</span>, <span title="peacock-like">pavonian</span> <span title="attire">arraiment</span>. Such could never enter the cycle of my recognized <span title="lovers">amorists</span>.

        <p><span title="Haste">Festination</span> by many of my sex to an <span title="inevitable">inextricable</span> <span title="marital">sponsal</span> <span title="binding together">colligation</span> with such <span title="furbished up for sale">mangonized</span> <span title="unknown people">quidams</span> and <span title="stupid fellows">asinegos</span>, has <span title="frequently">crebrously</span> <span title="clouded">obnubilated</span> the most <span title="shining">lucent</span> <span title="foresight">prospicience</span> of <span title="cheerful">alger</span> <span title="youth">juvenility</span>. Such <span title="outcomes">eventuations</span> made me <span title="timid">meticulous</span>, and by no means, <span title="prone">proclive</span> to <span title="yoke">adjugate</span> my <span title="earthly">mundane</span> <span title="assignment">allotment</span> to any <span title="husband">goman</span>, or animal <span title="featherless">implumed</span> <span title="two legged animal">biped</span>. I came almost to the <span title="conclusion">illation</span> to become a <span title="believer in keeping a growing population in check">Malthusian</span>; at least, to be <span title="wandering alone">solivagant</span> through this <span title="many roaded">multivious</span> <span title="world">megacosm</span> to my ultimate <span title="resting place">requietory</span>.

        <p>Since our <span title="face to face">tete a tete</span> <span title="speaking together">collocution</span> in the <span title="mansion">manse</span> of the <span title="friendly">amicable</span> <span title="innkeeper">aubergist</span>, during <span title="fair-like">nundinal</span> occasion, I have had an <span title="indescribable">ineffable</span> <span title="propensity">propendency</span> for your society. Moreover, your <span title="wisdom giving">sapiential</span> <span title="letter">epistle</span> caused <span title="an expulsion">a bannition</span> of all <span title="balancing">equilibration</span> from my <span title="turned up">lacerated</span> <span title="breast">petto</span>, and <span title="foreshadowed">premonstrated</span> to me that you are, by no means, an <span title="illiterate person">agrammatist</span>, but in <span title="truth">verity</span> a <span title="wise">sapient</span> <span title="lovely letter writing">belletristical</span> <span title="lover of learning">philomath</span>.

        <p>You were not wholly <span title="unknown">ignote</span> to me prior to my primal vision of you at our <span title="accidental">adventive</span> meeting and <span title="informal conversation">confabulation</span>. Your <span title="photograph">heliograph</span> had already fallen under my vision, and caused me to cherish a <span title="previous estimation">preexistimation</span> for you.

        <p>However, in my <span title="meditations">cogitations</span> as to the <span title="prior requirements">prerequisites</span>, and characteristic qualifications of him who may wish to be my marital <span title="companion">comate</span>, I have formulated the following; -

        <p>Primarily, he must be a <span title="substantial householder">franklin, or yeoman</span>, though not <span title="a near-river dweller">an amnicolist</span>. His <span title="rural">agrestical</span> mansion must have <span title="an oaken">a roboreous</span> <span title="framework">contignation</span>, <span title="smooth">glabrous</span> floors, <span title="countless">multitudinous</span> <span title="windows">fenestral apertures</span>, an imposing <span title="room furnished with seats">exedra</span>, or <span title="veranda">antesolarium</span>, various <span title="clothing rooms">vestiaries</span>, and a <span title="bathing room">balneary</span>. It must be well <span title="arched over">camerated</span>, and impervious to the <span title="very cold">hyperborean</span> <span title="freezing">frigefactive</span> <span title="blows">perflations</span> of the <span title="north wind">Aquilon</span>. It must be <span title="surrounded">environed</span> by ample avenues, covered with <span title="sawdust-resembling">scorbiform</span> and <span title="sandy">arenaceous</span> material. A <span title="cold">gelid</span> <span title="spring">puit</span> must not be <span title="lacking">minus</span>.

        <p>The <span title="house">housal</span> <span title="furniture">furnishments</span> must be of medium <span title="preciousness">preciosity</span>. In the <span title="cooking">culinary</span> department, <span title="lard">adeps</span>, <span title="floury">farinaceous</span>, <span title="milky">lactaceous</span>, <span title="eggy">ovicular</span>, and <span title="sugary">saccharine</span> substances for the <span title="making">facture</span> of <span title="many-kinded">omnigenous</span> <span title="custards">doucets</span>, <span title="fine flour cakes">simnels</span>, and <span title="various">omnifarious</span> <span title="bread-like">pannary</span> <span title="foods">comestibles</span>, must not be wanting. <span title="Fans">Flabels</span>, <span title="friction matches">locofocos, or allumettes</span>, and <span title="greasy">sebaceous</span> and kerosene <span title="light-bearing">luciferous</span> <span title="lamps">lucerns</span>, and other nocturnal <span title="light givers">illuminators</span> must be in abundance.

        <p>The <span title="stables">ecuries</span> and the <span title="cow houses">byres</span>, as also their <span title="surroundings">environs</span>, must <span title="abound">exuberate</span> in <span title="mounts">montures</span>, and other <span title="saddle horses">equines</span>; also, <span title="countless">multitudinous</span> <span title="oxen-like">bovine</span>, <span title="cow-like">vaccine</span>, <span title="calf-like">vituline</span>, <span title="wool-bearing">lanigerous</span> <span title="sheep-like">ovine</span>, and <span title="pig-like">porcine, or suilline</span>, <span title="four-legged animals">quadrupeds</span>; all in a state of <span title="plump">rotund</span> <span title="fattening">impinguation, or sagination</span>. <span title="Crooked horned">Reciprocornous</span> <span title="butting">arietating</span> <span title="bad smelling">malodorous</span> <span title="goats">hircines</span> will not be tolerated.

        <p>The <span title="body">corporeal structure</span> of him who is to be my <span title="companion">comate</span>, must not be too <span title="tall">procere</span>; - at least, he must be a <span title="giant">brobdingnagian</span>, - and by no means, must he be a <span title="dwarf">homunculus</span>. Not too <span title="plump">rotund</span> nor too angular. He must be <span title="equal legged">equicrural</span>, and not <span title="big footed">macropodous</span> or <span title="limp">claudicant</span>; not <span title="long-jawed">macrognathic</span> or <span title="large-eared">macrotous</span>; and somewhat <span title="large brained">macrencephalous</span>. In <span title="truth">verity</span>, his physique must be <span title="fair">adonean</span>.

        <p>He must be very <span title="skilled">deft</span> in his <span title="clothing">arraiment</span>, and keep his <span title="lips">labials</span> <span title="cleansed">mundified</span> from all <span title="tobacco">nicotian</span> <span title="juice">succulence</span>; - in <span title="truth">verity</span>, <span title="diligently">sedulously</span> <span title="avoid">evitate</span>, at all times, the <span title="chewing">manducation</span>, <span title="smoking">ebullition</span>, and <span title="breathing in through the nose">nasal inhalation</span> of the <span title="harmful">noxious</span> <span title="plant">plantage</span>. He must not be <span title="a lover of wine">an oenophilist</span>, but a very <span title="self-disciplined">abstemious</span> <span title="abstainer from spirituous liquor">nephalist</span>. He must <span title="avoid">evitate</span> <span title="want of care">disassiduity</span> as to the <span title="cleansing">mundification</span> of his <span title="teeth">dental organs</span>, and <span title="skin">cutaneous</span> surface. He must never be <span title="lazy">desidious</span> in <span title="feet bathing">pediluvy</span>, <span title="bathing">balneation</span>, and <span title="washing with salt water">salination</span>, for the <span title="removal">remotion</span> of <span title="strong scent">hogo</span>, occasioned by <span title="sweating">exsudations</span>, and <span title="skin">dermal</span> <span title="shedding">desquamations</span>. During a <span title="stormy">procellous</span> and <span title="muddy">lutarious</span> season, he must <span title="diligently">sedulously</span> <span title="cleanse">absterge</span> all <span title="mud coatings">illutation</span> from his <span title="feet">pedial extremities</span>, prior to making his <span title="entry">introgression</span> to the house.

        <p><span title="Spitting">Sputation</span> on the <span title="tapestry">tapis</span> will not be tolerated, and the nonessential <span title="exceedingly filthy">augean</span> <span title="receptacle for spit">cuspidor</span> must be - <span title="not present">non est</span>.

        <p>All <span title="muttering">mussitation</span> relative to the <span title="digestion">elixation</span> and preparation of <span title="edible">cibarious</span> articles of <span title="nourishment">alimentation</span>, are <span title="absolutely">peremptorily</span> <span title="forbidden">tabooed</span>.

        <p>In company, he must be <span title="courteous">bonair</span> and <span title="affable">homiletic</span>; and never <span title="quarrelsome">querulential</span>, or of too <span title="authoritative">potestative</span> <span title="carriage">portance</span>. In his <span title="conversation">collocution</span>, he must be a <span title="person who discusses any subject at pleasure">quodlibetarian</span>, but not a <span title="conversation monopolizer">monologist</span>; and by no means, <span title="pompous">pompatic</span>, <span title="disposed to take offense">umbratious</span>, <span title="headstrong">temerarious</span>, <span title="unlearned">clerkless</span>, or <span title="artless">incony</span>; devoid of all <span title="lack of patriotism">incivism</span>, <span title="laziness">inertitude</span>, <span title="carelessness">perfunctoriness</span>, and <span title="deception">ingannation</span>. He must not be a <span title="meticulous">punctilious</span> <span title="restraining person">precisianist</span>; never too <span title="fault finding">captious</span>, and <span title="jeeringly">scoptically</span> <span title="critically nice">nasute</span>; never guilty of <span title="tedious talk without much substance">macrology</span>, <span title="the love of empty talk">psilology</span>, <span title="stammering">balbucination</span>, or <span title="the unconscious saying of what is not intended to be said">heterophemy</span>.

        <p>By no means, must he be <span title="deeply snoring">stertorous</span> in his <span title="sleep">obdormition</span>, or be subject to <span title="talking in sleep">somniloquism</span> and <span title="walking in sleep">somnambulism</span>. In his <span title="laboriousness">operosity</span> in this <span title="under the heavens">subcelestial</span> <span title="sphere of action">arena</span>, he must not be a <span title="worshiper of money">mammonite</span>, or be given to <span title="worshiping the world">cosmolatry</span>. He must be very <span title="talkative">homiletical</span> and altruistic towards <span title="people who subsist on charity">eleemosynaries</span>, inmates of <span title="hospitals for orphans">orphanotrophies</span>, <span title="those living on alms">sportularies</span>, and those in a state of <span title="impoverished">obolary</span> <span title="widowhood">viduity</span>.

        <p><span title="Union">Adunation</span> with any of the <span title="existing">existential</span> <span title="secret">cryptic</span> <span title="societies">germanities</span>, or guilds, and all <span title="wanderings in the night">noctivagations</span>, and <span title="wanderings all over the place">omnivagations</span>, subjecting me to <span title="solitariness">solitariety</span>, and <span title="concerned">solicitous</span> <span title="vigils">excubations</span>, must never characterize him.

        <p>Indiscriminate <span title="being bound as surety for another">fidejussion</span> must never have <span title="indwelling">immanency</span> in his <span title="brain">harns</span>. <span title="A renunciation">An abjurement</span> of all <span title="adherence to a false religion">miscreance</span> and <span title="ruling by demons">demonocracy</span> and <span title="worship by demons">demonolatry</span>; and a <span title="sincere">cordial</span> <span title="acceptance">acceptation</span> of Christianity, must ever <span title="characterize">denote</span> him.

        <p>He must be <span title="playful">lusory</span> with the <span title="children">bairns</span>, and <span title="exemplary">paradigmatic</span> to them; and <span title="humor">indulge</span> them freely in their <span title="people-mimicking">anthropomorphized</span> feats of <span title="horsemanship">equestrianism</span> and <span title="shadow fighting">sciomachy</span>, and in their <span title="unreal">barmecidal</span> <span title="luxurious">sybaritic</span> feasts; and <span title="educate">erudiate</span> and indoctrinate them to be <span title="truthful">veridical</span>, without <span title="rod punishing">baculine</span> <span title="beating">vapulation</span>, or <span title="cudgeling">fustigation</span>.

        <p>The <span title="marital">sponsal</span> <span title="securities">munities</span> I claim for myself, are:- To be <span title="female sovereign">autocratrix</span> in all departments of the <span title="residence">domicile</span>, and assume full <span title="union of interests">solidarity</span> -<span title="elsewhere">alibi</span>, -<span title="everywhere">algates</span>. Consent for <span title="drawn out">protracted</span> <span title="excursions">evagations</span>, and <span title="ridings about">obequitations</span>, when <span title="desired">desiderated</span>, must be <span title="lively">alacriously</span> granted. All <span title="seed sowing">seminations</span>, <span title="weeding outs">aberuncations</span>, and <span title="weedings">sarculations</span> in the <span title="garden-belonging">hortulan</span> <span title="separating hedge">sepiment</span>; the <span title="feeding">pabulation</span> of <span title="cow-like">vaccine</span>, <span title="horse-like">equine</span>, and <span title="curly tailed">curvicaudate</span> <span title="pig-like">porcine</span> <span title="four legged animals">quadrupeds</span>; and the <span title="weaning">ablactation</span> of the <span title="bellowing">mugient</span> <span title="calf-like">vituline</span> <span title="four legged animals">quadrupeds</span>; and in <span title="truth">verity</span>, all <span title="servile">latreutical</span> work about the <span title="large stable for horses">equerry</span>, the <span title="cow house">vaccary</span> and the <span title="dairyhouse">lactary</span>, is most explicitly <span title="rejected">recused</span>.

        <p>In case the <span title="death">omega</span> of my <span title="marital">sponsal</span> partner should <span title="precede">antedate</span> mine, <span title="pledging">impignoration</span> not to enjoy <span title="the state of being married twice">digamy, or deuterogamy</span>, will not be given in my <span title="betrothal">desponsation</span> to any <span title="descendant of Adam">adamite</span>, or masculine <span title="two legged animal">biped</span> of <span title="humankind">the genus homo</span>. Should a <span title="dissolution">catalysis</span> of the <span title="marital">sponsal</span> affiliation even, - and that by <span title="divorce">diffarreation</span>, on account of <span title="drunkenness">inebriety</span>, or any other <span title="evil doing">malefaction</span>, then, a <span title="division into two parts">dimidiation</span> of the <span title="property">acquisitions</span> would have to occur.

        <p>Finally, should my <span title="husband">mari</span> and I enjoy <span title="growing old together">consenescence</span>, and be nearly <span title="dying together at the same time">commorient</span>, and my <span title="death">obital period</span> <span title="come before">antevene</span> his, then my <span title="desire">desideration</span> is, to be <span title="buried with funeral rites">funerated</span> <span title="gently and nicely">debonairly</span> in a <span title="neat">feateous</span> <span title="resting place">requietory</span>. Such are the <span title="securities">munities</span> I reserve for myself, and to which I <span title="suspect">surmise</span> you will readily yield <span title="agreement">assentment</span>. Your <span title="beyond common people">supravulgar</span> <span title="thoughts">cogitations</span>, as well as your position beyond the <span title="outskirts">purlieus</span> of <span title="vulgarity">plebeiance</span> must <span title="clearly">lucidly</span> <span title="represent beforehand">premonstrate</span> it.

        <p>On condition of compliance with the above <span title="requirements">requisitions</span>, I accept your <span title="offered">proffered</span> <span title="girdle">cincture</span> of <span title="the god of marriage">Hymen</span>, with the <span title="hope">esperance</span> that our <span title="marital">connubial</span> <span title="union">adunation</span> and consequent <span title="union of interests">solidarity</span> and interdependency may cause an <span title="improvement">amelioration</span> of the <span title="difficulties">asperities</span> incident to our <span title="earthly">terrestrial</span> <span title="life">vitality</span>, and aid us in the <span title="avoiding">devitation</span> of many of the <span title="temptations">tentations</span> in this <span title="unclean">immund</span> and <span title="polluted">inquinated</span> <span title="world">mundane structure</span>; and I leave it to your <span title="decision">arbitrament</span> to designate the day of <span title="celebration of the nuptial feast">bridality</span>. <span title="By chance">Perchance</span> the <span title="next">proximate</span> <span title="full moon">plenilune</span> would be the most <span title="fitting">idoneous</span> period for the <span title="marital">hymeneal</span> <span title="union">conjugation</span>; and may the <span title="heavenly">supermundane</span> powers invest the <span title="bridal">paranymphal</span> occasion with their <span title="favorable">auspicious</span> <span title="blessing">benison</span>.
        In <span title="a golden">an aureate</span> <span title="binding">ligature</span>,
        Your <span title="everlasting">eviternal</span> <span title="pledged to be married">affianced</span>,
        E.M. Amenity.

        <p>Fritz has given me <span title="assurance">assecuration</span> that the said <span title="bridal">paranymphal</span> occasion will occur as suggested, and not on the <span title="time that will never come">Greek calends</span>. However, as to the culmination and final sequel, - more <span title="in a little while">anon</span>.

        <p>I will now bring to a <span title="conclusion">finis</span> this <span title="long worded">sesquipedalian</span> <span title="badly written">cacographical</span> scrawl, with the assurance that
        I am,
        Yours, <span title="school master like">pedantically</span>,

        <h1>Letter VII,</h1>
        <h2><span title="Main City">Megalopolis</span> of the <span title="West">Occident</span></h2>
        <h3>July 4, 1873</h3>

        <p>Most <span title="rewording to clarify">paraphrastical</span> Sir:-

        <p>In my <span title="preceding">predecessive</span> <span title="bombastic">lexiphanic</span> communication, I gave you a <span title="concise">compendious</span> biographical sketch of Fritz, and his <span title="lovemaking">amatorial</span> experience. I now, <span title="early in the morning">rathe</span> on this, our national <span title="holiday">ferial</span> occasion, again bring into <span title="demand">requisition</span>, my <span title="overflowing">scaturient</span> pen, and <span title="excessive">plethoric</span> <span title="abundance">cornucopia</span> of <span title="old">arcane</span> <span title="long words">sesquipedalities</span>, and <span title="try">essay</span> to <span title="think out">excogitate</span> yet another <span title="ornate">euphuistic</span>, <span title="mystical">cabalistical</span> <span title="letter">epistolary</span> <span title="outpouring">effusion</span>; but, being at present, otherwise somewhat pragmatically engaged, I shall be, necessarily, more <span title="brief">laconic</span>.

        <p>On a certain <span title="Sunday">dominical day</span>, recently, I repaired to a <span title="place">locality</span> where <span title="listening">audition</span> was given to a certain <span title="minister">ecclesiastic</span>. The <span title="crowd">conflux</span> was <span title="large">ample</span>.

        <p>The <span title="choir director">precentor, or accentor</span> of the <span title="choir singers">quiristers</span>, <span title="began">inchoated</span> the initial sonata with too much altitude of <span title="musical tone">intonation</span>, which produced considerable <span title="hoarseness">raucity</span> in his <span title="throaty">guttural</span> <span title="opening">orifice</span> before its <span title="ending">termination</span>; especially during the <span title="choir's chant response">antiphon</span>.

        <p><span title="Following">Subsequent to</span> this <span title="singing">cantation</span>, there was a general <span title="silence">taciturnity</span>. He was <span title="golden-haired">auricomous</span> and his <span title="face">countenance</span> was <span title="gloomy">saturnine</span>. His <span title="appearance">aspect</span> was <span title="youthful">juvenile</span>; his <span title="bodily">corporeal</span> structure was <span title="slender">gracile</span>; his <span title="nose">nasal protrusion, or olfactor</span> <span title="had">possessed</span> <span title="exceptional">singular</span> <span title="thinness">tenuity</span>, and <span title="came to a point">cacuminated</span> <span title="surprisingly">astoundingly</span>. His theme was <span title="hope">esperance</span>. In his <span title="introductory oration">exordium</span>, or <span title="outline of subjects to be discussed">catastasis</span>, he was somewhat tranquil, but not <span title="educational">didascalic</span>. In a <span title="briefness">brevity</span> of time, however, he became <span title="loud">stentorophonic</span> and <span title="bubbling">spumous</span> in his <span title="mouth">oral aperture</span>. His <span title="spittings">sputations</span> became frequent, and his <span title="eyelid">palpebral</span> and <span title="eyelash">ciliary</span> organs gained indescribable <span title="speed">celerity</span>. <span title="Stupefying">Obstupefaction</span> seized his <span title="disciples">sectators</span> in view of his supposed <span title="varied learnedness">polymathy</span>; but his <span title="explanatory">hermeneutical</span> <span title="clarification">eclaircissement</span> of his subject was <span title="encoded">cryptic</span>, <span title="impossibly arrived at">acataleptic</span>, and <span title="speculative">hypothetical</span>, as well as <span title="problematic">problematical</span> and <span title="ambiguous in grammatical construction">amphibological</span>.

        <p>His <span title="language of doubtful meaning">ambilogy</span>, <span title="lofty speech">altiloquence</span>, and <span title="boastful speech">largiloquence</span>, <span title="excited">exsuscitated</span> my <span title="derisive laughter">irrision</span>. The <span title="disputational">eristical</span> part of his <span title="sermon">homily</span> was <span title="full of">fraught with</span> <span title="absurdities">alogies</span> and <span title="false reasonings">paralogies</span>, and furnished an <span title="unquestionable">indubitable</span> <span title="support of a proposition by reference to common knowledge">apodixis</span> of his <span title="stupidity">insipience</span> in honorable <span title="refutations of doctrine">polemics</span>, and <span title="the art of rhetorical theology">homiletics</span>. Towards <span title="differers in belief">dissentients</span>, he <span title="showed">evinced</span> such discourtesy and <span title="dislike">displacency</span> as <span title="irritated">exacerbated</span> my interior nature.

        <p>When his course was <span title="questioning">zetetic</span>, he propounded the most <span title="nonsensically poetic">amphigorical</span> and <span title="irrelevant">extraneous</span> interrogations; and his <span title="responses">responsions</span> <span title="to that">thereto</span> were <span title="fancifully imaginative">chimerical</span>, <span title="using the wrong words in context">catachrestical</span>, and totally irrelevant. In his <span title="loud complaints">vociferations</span>, there was occasionally a <span title="sudden">subitaneous</span> <span title="difficulty of speaking">dysphony</span>; <span title="rare">seldom</span> <span title="agreeable sounds">euphony</span>, but the most <span title="painful">cruciating</span> <span title="bad sounds">cacophony</span>. As to his <span title="celestial">supernal</span> <span title="inspiration">entheasm</span>, he labored under <span title="an imaginary">a Muggletonian</span> hallucination altogether.

        <p>His <span title="sermon">sermocination</span> had already <span title="surpassed">transcended</span> <span title="briefness">compendiosity</span>, and yet, he <span title="added">appended</span> a <span title="corny">platitudinous</span> <span title="conclusion">peroration</span>, in which he primarily <span title="bitterly complained">inveighed</span> against <span title="radical skepticism">pyrrhonism</span> that is becoming so <span title="presumptuously daring">temerarious</span> in this age; and after frowning it down by the <span title="sour-facedness">torvity</span> of <span title="face">visage</span>, he entered upon an <span title="unsuitable">inconcinnous</span>, and very <span title="severely critical">aristarchian</span>  <span title="exhorting speech">allocution</span> to his <span title="disciples">sectators</span>, in which he <span title="reproached">exprobrated</span> their <span title="sorrow for sin only for fear of damnation">attrition</span> and their want of <span title="true repentance">contrition</span>, and <span title="bowing">genuflection</span> in their <span title="earnest beggings">obtestations</span>; and <span title="keenly">trenchantly</span>, in very <span title="warning of punishment">comminatory</span> terms, <span title="reprimanded">vituperated</span> their <span title="silly talking">stultiloquence</span>, <span title="religious indifference">adiaphorism</span>, and their mutual <span title="slanders">obtrectations</span>; and by <span title="drawn out">protracted</span> <span title="repetitions of sound">tautophonies</span> insisted on an <span title="increase">auxesis</span> of their <span title="faith">foy</span>, and <span title="a literary deletion of objectionable parts">an expurgation</span> of their <span title="extremely wicked">nefarious</span> <span title="criminalities">piacularities</span> and <span title="atrociously sinful">nefandous</span> abominations; by <span title="ceaseless">indesinent</span> <span title="divine summoning">invocation</span>. He <span title="outlined">depainted</span> their <span title="many formed">multiform</span> <span title="temptations">tentations</span>, and gave them a <span title="fervent">calid</span> <span title="exhortation">hortation</span> to the <span title="exercise">exercitation</span> of <span title="hope">esperance</span> during the allotment of their <span title="worldly and non-spiritual">sublunary</span> <span title="life">vitality</span>. The <span title="prophesized">vaticinated</span> that then, in their entrance to the <span title="celestial">supernal</span> world, they should be <span title="indescribably">inenarrably</span> <span title="happy">felicitous</span>.

        <p>In his finale, he insisted on a <span title="brought together by contributions">collatitious</span> operation throughout the <span title="assembly">assemblage</span>, for <span title="saving from sin">redemption</span> of <span title="fighters of god">theomachists</span>, and the <span title="Heathens">ethnics</span> to the <span title="enjoyment">fruition</span> of ethical and theological <span title="awareness">cognoscence</span>; and after the <span title="drawing out">eduction</span> of <span title="dishonestly acquired money">pelf</span> from our <span title="money">nummary</span> receptacles, he prepared us, in a <span title="thanks giving">benedictory</span> <span title="prayer">orison</span>, for <span title="return">regression</span> to our <span title="homes">domiciliary tenements</span>.

        <p>On the succeeding <span title="morning">matin</span>, I set out for this metropolitan <span title="store">emporium</span>, or <span title="very large city">megalopolis</span> of the <span title="western">hesperian</span> plateaus, where I now temporarily <span title="stay">abide</span>.

        <p>The <span title="early morning">matutine</span> part of that day was characterized by all phases that possess <span title="power">puissance</span> to impart <span title="fullness">satiety</span> to the visual, <span title="hearing">auricular</span>, and <span title="smelling">olfactory</span> powers of our complex constitution.

        <p>The <span title="rising again">reorient</span> <span title="east-rising">exortive</span> <span title="Sun">solar luminary</span>, in his <span title="radiation">emanation</span>, or <span title="coming to light">exurgence</span>, from the <span title="eastern">oriental</span> <span title="pearly">margaric</span> portals, cast <span title="brightly shining">luculent</span> <span title="darting forth">rayonnant</span> <span title="flashes of brilliance">coruscations</span> into the <span title="cloudless">innubilous</span> <span title="sky-blue">azure</span> concavity; and his <span title="brilliant">efflugent</span> <span title="glowing">candent</span> <span title="rising">ascension</span> <span title="forced">coerced</span> the <span title="underground">subterrene</span> <span title="seed-like">seminal</span> and <span title="root-like">radical</span> deposits to <span title="germinate">pullulate</span> and <span title="scatter">diffuse</span> <span title="spring">vernal</span> <span title="greenness">viridity</span> over nature's <span title="wavy">undulating</span> surface. The <span title="wood">sylvan</span> regions, or rather, <span title="full of trees">nemorous</span> and <span title="arbuscle-full">arbuscular</span> <span title="river bank">riparian</span> <span title="thickets">boscages</span>, were <span title="full of">replete with</span> the most <span title="sweet-sounding">mellifluent</span> <span title="melodious">canorous</span> <span title="songs">cantations</span> of the <span title="feathered">pennated</span> <span title="inhabitants">tenants</span> of the <span title="airy">aerial</span> regions. The <span title="herby">herbaceous</span>, <span title="grassy">graminaceous</span>, and <span title="flower-bearing">floriferous</span> <span title="plants">foliage</span> having been <span title="moistened">humectated</span>, and made <span title="flowing with dew">rorifluent</span> by <span title="nightly">nocturnal</span> <span title="sprinklings with wet dew">irrorations</span>, emitted the most grateful <span title="fragrant">ambrosial</span> <span title="sweet scent">redolence</span>.

        <p>My functions are now <span title="mercantile">emporetical</span>, <span title="shorthand typing">amaneunsical</span>, and <span title="shorthand writing">brachygraphical</span>. I am quite <span title="busily">negotiously</span> engaged, and somewhat a <span title="laborer of the night">lychnobite</span>.

        <p>As a <span title="state of unwillingness">nolleity</span> to <span title="stay">abide</span> here coerces me, and moreover since - <span title="change of pasture makes fat calves">"remudas de pasturage haze bizerros gordos"</span>, - I shall perhaps, during the <span title="autumn">autumnal</span> season, resume my <span title="frequent wandering">multivagous</span> and <span title="world wandering">mundivagant</span> <span title="wanderings">pererrations</span>; which may <span title="chance to happen">eventuate</span> in my <span title="passing over">transfretations</span> of the Pacific ocean, and <span title="travelling around">circumnavagation</span> of this <span title="land">terrene</span>.

        <p>Till which time,
        I shall remain,
        Your <span title="same country dwelling">conterraneous</span> <span title="person living at the same time">cotemporary</span>,
        Ivan
