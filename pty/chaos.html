  The Chaos
  </div>
  by Gerard Nolst Trenité

  <br>
  <br>

  <div class="story">
  <br>Dearest creature in creation,
  <br>Study English pronunciation.
  <br>I will teach you in my verse
  <br>Sounds like corpse, corps, horse, and worse.
  <br>I will keep you, Suzy, busy,
  <br>Make your head with heat grow dizzy.
  <br>Tear in eye, your dress will tear.
  <br>So shall I! Oh hear my prayer.
  <br>
  <br>Just compare heart, beard, and heard,
  <br>Dies and diet, lord and word,
  <br>Sword and sward, retain and Britain.
  <br>(Mind the latter, how it’s written.)
  <br>Now I surely will not plague you
  <br>With such words as plaque and ague.
  <br>But be careful how you speak:
  <br>Say break and steak, but bleak and streak;
  <br>Cloven, oven, how and low,
  <br>Script, receipt, show, poem, and toe.
  <br>
  <br>Hear me say, devoid of trickery,
  <br>Daughter, laughter, and Terpsichore,
  <br>Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles,
  <br>Exiles, similes, and reviles;
  <br>Scholar, vicar, and cigar,
  <br>
  <br>Solar, mica, war and far;
  <br>One, anemone, Balmoral,
  <br>Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel;
  <br>Gertrude, German, wind and mind,
  <br>Scene, Melpomene, mankind.
  <br>
  <br>Billet does not rhyme with ballet,
  <br>Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet.
  <br>Blood and flood are not like food,
  <br>Nor is mould like should and would.
  <br>Viscous, viscount, load and broad,
  <br>Toward, to forward, to reward.
  <br>And your pronunciation’s OK
  <br>When you correctly say croquet,
  <br>Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,
  <br>Friend and fiend, alive and live.
  <br>
  <br>Ivy, privy, famous; clamour
  <br>And enamour rhyme with hammer.
  <br>River, rival, tomb, bomb, comb,
  <br>Doll and roll and some and home.
  <br>Stranger does not rhyme with anger,
  <br>Neither does devour with clangour.
  <br>Souls but foul, haunt but aunt,
  <br>Font, front, wont, want, grand, and grant,
  <br>Shoes, goes, does. Now first say finger,
  <br>And then singer, ginger, linger,
  <br>Real, zeal, mauve, gauze, gouge and gauge,
  <br>Marriage, foliage, mirage, and age.
  <br>
  <br>Query does not rhyme with very,
  <br>Nor does fury sound like bury.
  <br>Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth.
  <br>Job, nob, bosom, transom, oath.
  <br>Though the differences seem little,
  <br>We say actual but victual.
  <br>Refer does not rhyme with deafer.
  <br>Foeffer does, and zephyr, heifer.
  <br>Mint, pint, senate and sedate;
  <br>Dull, bull, and George ate late.
  <br>Scenic, Arabic, Pacific,
  <br>Science, conscience, scientific.
  <br>
  <br>Liberty, library, heave and heaven,
  <br>Rachel, ache, moustache, eleven.
  <br>We say hallowed, but allowed,
  <br>People, leopard, towed, but vowed.
  <br>
  <br>Mark the differences, moreover,
  <br>Between mover, cover, clover;
  <br>Leeches, breeches, wise, precise,
  <br>Chalice, but police and lice;
  <br>Camel, constable, unstable,
  <br>Principle, disciple, label.
  <br>
  <br>Petal, panel, and canal,
  <br>Wait, surprise, plait, promise, pal.
  <br>Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair,
  <br>Senator, spectator, mayor.
  <br>Tour, but our and succour, four.
  <br>Gas, alas, and Arkansas.
  <br>Sea, idea, Korea, area,
  <br>Psalm, Maria, but malaria.
  <br>Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean.
  <br>Doctrine, turpentine, marine.
  <br>
  <br>Compare alien with Italian,
  <br>Dandelion and battalion.
  <br>Sally with ally, yea, ye,
  <br>Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, and key.
  <br>Say aver, but ever, fever,
  <br>Neither, leisure, skein, deceiver.
  <br>Heron, granary, canary.
  <br>Crevice and device and aerie.
  <br>
  <br>Face, but preface, not efface.
  <br>Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass.
  <br>Large, but target, gin, give, verging,
  <br>Ought, out, joust and scour, scourging.
  <br>Ear, but earn and wear and tear
  <br>Do not rhyme with here but ere.
  <br>Seven is right, but so is even,
  <br>Hyphen, roughen, nephew Stephen,
  <br>Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk,
  <br>Ask, grasp, wasp, and cork and work.
  <br>
  <br>Pronunciation — think of Psyche!
  <br>Is a paling stout and spikey?
  <br>Won’t it make you lose your wits,
  <br>Writing groats and saying grits?
  <br>It’s a dark abyss or tunnel:
  <br>Strewn with stones, stowed, solace, gunwale,
  <br>Islington and Isle of Wight,
  <br>Housewife, verdict and indict.
  <br>
  <br>Finally, which rhymes with enough —
  <br>Though, through, plough, or dough, or cough?
  <br>Hiccough has the sound of cup.
  <br>My advice is to give up!!!
