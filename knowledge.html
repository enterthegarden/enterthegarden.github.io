  KNOWLEDGE


<div class="story">


  <p>
    Real knowledge is hard won, and hard kept, through diligent, first hand effort. It is not a set of facts retrievable from memory, otherwise we might say computers have knowledge. Nor is it a condensation of abstractions imprinted upon a page. That said, knowledge must rest on facts. So, here is a selection of key facts compressed into a small space. As more is learned, they will be updated. They are part of self-education and can be freely distributed. Get knowledgable!

  <p>
    <b>Universe</b>: space, time & its contents. Originated ~13.8B yrs ago via Big Bang. Observable Universe is 93B LY wide; expands & accelerates due to dark energy. Pre-scientific models were Earth-centric; modern ones assert edgeless, centerless, & largely uniform universe. Lambda-CDM model asserts ~70% of mass/energy is dark energy, ~25% is dark matter, ~5% ordinary matter. Gravity coalesced early H & He gases into 1st stars. Sun is 1 of ~200B stars in Milky Way, itself 1 of ~200B galaxies in Observable Universe. Its expansion may culminate in Heat Death.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Earth</b>: 3rd planet from Sun & sole known life-host. Formed ~4.5B yrs ago via Solar System dust accretion. Earth's shape is ellipsoidal & ~12,742 km wide; structured as iron core, mantle, & crust. Atmosphere: 78% N, 21% O, & trace gases. Surface is 71% H2O in oceans & poles. Tectonic plates yield seismic activity: quakes & volcanoes. Magnetosphere, generated by liquid outer core, protects us from harmful solar winds. Moon, only natural satellite, visible via reflected sunlight. Earth’s tilt (23.5°) & orbit cause seasons; axial rotation causes day-night cycle.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Life</b>: grows, reacts, adapts, reproduces, uses energy. Emerged ~3.5B yrs ago, possibly from non-living matter. Cells, basic units of life, vary in form & function. Organisms range from single-celled bacteria to multicellular plants & animals. ~2M recorded species on Earth, many threatened. Diversity arises via variation & natural selection. DNA in cells encodes genetic instructions; all known life carbon-based w/ H2O as solvent. >99% of all species ever lived now extinct. Extraterrestrial life sought on Earth-like exoplanets.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Science</b>: study of nature yielding testable explanations & predictions. Branches: formal, natural, social, & applied. Revolutionised 400 yrs ago w/ heliocentric model. Scientific method: observation -> hypothesis -> experimentation. Key theories: relativity (gravity warps space-time via mass & energy), atomic theory (particles behave by probabilistic laws), evolution (species change via natural selection). Mathematical modelling links maths & science, enables numerical predictions. Key concerns: responsible research & environmental stewardship.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Technology</b>: practical application of scientific knowledge. Types: agricultural, medical, manufacturing, transport, communication. Fire control by ancestors meant cooking, warmth, & protection. Farming, 13k yrs ago, stabilised food supply, enabling civilization. Writing, 5k yrs ago, meant preservation & transgenerational transfer of knowledge. Electricity powered Industrial Revolution, both ~200 yrs ago, a shift from handcrafted to machine-made goods; now powers computing. Emerging techs incl. robotics, blockchains, AI. Key concerns: privacy, job displacement, & climate change.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Art</b>: human creative expression. Branches: visual, performing, literary, culinary, & applied. Dates back ~50k yrs in visual form; likely older in singing & storytelling. Serves communication, devotion, critique, therapy. Genres & movements exist but defy full systematisation. Creation involves subject preparation, piece crafting, & appreciation. Restoration possible if creator's intent known. Museums vital for preservation, democratisation, cultural heritage. AI's role in art creation prompts questions re: artist & future. Key concerns: appropriation, forgery, censorship.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Language</b>: communication system w/ vocab & grammar. May be 150k yrs old; origins elusive. ~7k languages exist today; 1 extinct every 2 wks. Spoken or signed, >4k written; human language is unique in discussing imaginary/absent subjects. Top languages: English, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, Mandarin. Langs evolve w/ culture via migration, isolation, trade. ~150 language families based on evolutionary lineage. Best language learning period: 0 to 7 yrs old. Key concerns: preservation & natural language processing by computers.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Humans</b>: most prevalent primate species. Originated in Africa ~300k yrs ago. Largely nomadic hunter-gatherers until Neolithic Revolution 13k yrs ago led to settlement & farming. Current pop. ~8B; >~100B ever born. Bipedalism distinguishes from other great apes; highly social, forming families, kin groups, states. Social structures show diverse values, norms, and rituals. Genetically 99% identical, yet diverse in traits. Unique in abstraction, planning, empathy. Moon-visited in '69; potential for multiplanetary existence.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Civilization</b>: complex society w/ advanced infrastructure, culture, gov't. Arose independently at least 6x, esp. in Fertile Crescent. Antiquity advanced politics & philosophy. Middle ages saw religious shifts, empire expansion, scientific rigor. Modernity marked by tech-driven globalisation & digital age. ~200 sovereign states, many disputed. Legal systems mostly civil or common law, influenced by human rights. Economic systems largely market-oriented, capitalist-socialist mix. Political systems range from totalitarian to democratic, often hybrids. Global risks: climate change, WWIII, unaligned AI.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Religion</b>: system of beliefs & practices linking humanity to spiritual elements; lacks scholarly consensus on precise definition. Religious-like rituals, like burial, date back at least 100k yrs. ~10k distinct religions globally; most small & local. 77% of populace Christian, Muslim, Hindu, or Buddhist. Hinduism, rooted in Indian subcontinent, arose 3500 yrs ago. Buddhism arose 2500 yrs ago in NE India. Christianity, largest religion, arose 2000 yrs ago in Middle East. Islam, fastest-growing, arose 1400 yrs ago in Middle East. Key concerns: extremism, pluralism, secularism.

  </p>

  <p>
    <b>*Globalisation</b>: increasing interconnection & interdependence of world's economies, cultures, populations. Early trade routes (Silk Road ~130 BCE), Age of Exploration (~15th c.), colonialism spread goods & ideas. Accelerated in late 20th c. with tech advances (internet, air travel). Facets: economic (trade, investment, MNCs), cultural (media, arts, language), political (intl. orgs, treaties), technological (innovation spread). Benefits: economic growth, access to goods/services, cultural exchange, tech diffusion. Drawbacks: job displacement, cultural homogenization, inequality, enviro degradation. Institutions: WTO, IMF, World Bank facilitate globalization. Anti-globalization movements cite social justice, enviro concerns. Future challenges: managing global governance, fair trade, protecting local cultures, collaborative climate action.

    <b>Prehistory</b>: c. 3.3 mya - 5 kya. Humans evolved in Africa; split from chimps 13 - 5 mya. Hominins used tools by 3.3 mya, Homo emerged 2.8 mya, and H. erectus left Africa 2 mya. Homo diversified by 500 kya, interbreeding with Neanderthals, Denisovans. H. sapiens, arising ~300 kya, crafted jewellery by 100 kya & weapons by 50 kya. Leaving Africa 194 kya, non-Africans descended from a group 70 - 50 kya. The Neolithic Revolution (~12 kya) introduced global agriculture and cities; metalwork starting by 8.4 kya. Neolithic societies, e.g. Göbekli Tepe, often worshipped nature.

  <p>
    <b>Ancient History</b>: c. 3000 BCE - 500 CE. 1st civs. by rivers: Sumerians, Egyptians, Indus Valley, & China; American Andean & Mayans too. Writing began in Sumer & independently in others. Bronze (c. 3300 BCE) & Iron Ages (c. 1200 BCE) marked tech & military advances. Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism arose. Ancient Greece & Rome (kingdom -> republic (conquered Greece) -> empire) emerged shaping philosophy, governance, warfare. Christianity: persecuted by -> dominated Rome. Silk Road helped global trade & cultural exchange. Rome split (286 CE) & its Western empire fell (476 CE).
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Post-Classical History</b>: c. 500 - 1500. China innovates (gunpowder, printing), cycles dynasties (incl. Sui-Tang). Pre-7th c. M. East: Byzantine, Sasanian, then Islamic expansion & scholarly Golden Age. Crusades (1096-1291) destabilise Byzantine; later Mongol, Seljuk rule; Constantinople falls (1453). Europe: plague-struck (Black Death 1347-51) in Middle Ages. East-West Schism (1054). S. Asia & W. Africa form Islamic, regional empires (eg, Mali). Sub-Saharan Africa: Aksum; SE Asia: Khmer. Japan: imperial -> feudal. Americas: Mississippians, Aztecs; S. America: vast Inca empire.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Early Modern History</b>: c. 1500 - 1800. America colonisation begins Exploration era (1492); European empires (Portuguese, Dutch, British) drive proto-globalization. Reformation (1517-1648) splits Catholic Church; Enlightenment boosts reason & individualism; Scientific Revolution (1543-1687) advances knowledge. Ottomans & Mughals influence Asia; Renaissance emphasizes humanism & arts in Europe. Africa entwined transatlantic slave trade. China & Japan navigate foreign relations; Europe colonizes Americas & SE Asia. USA founded (1776); French Revolution (1789-99) reshapes Europe.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Late Modern History</b>: c. 1800 - now. Industrial Rev. (18-20c.) sparks in UK, spreads. Europe colonises Asia & Africa. Later decolonises post-WWI (14-18) & WWII (39-45). Cold War (47-91) & Space Race (55-69) shape geopolitics. China evolves: Mao era (famines) to global econ. power. Post-91: US leads, EU consolidates, tech & internet surge. Terrorism ascends: 9/11 (01) ignites War on Terror, altering global security. 21c. digital age, globalisation, COVID-19 pandemic, climate crisis. India, Africa, & S. America navigate post-colonialism.

    <b>Philosophy</b>: study of fundamentals of knowledge, value, & reason. Historically covered all knowledge. Modern branches: epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, metaphysics, & logic. Independent emergence in Ancient Greece (Socrates, Plato), Arabic-Persian world (Avicenna), India (Upanishads), & China (Tao Te Ching). Uses methods like thought experiments & Socratic questioning. Tackles questions on life's meaning & consciousness; incl. movements like existentialism. Today, intersects with tech, ethics, & AI challenges.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Time</b>: indefinite continued progression of events; past, present, future as a whole. Fundamental SI unit is second, defined by caesium atom transitions. Historically measured by sundials, mechanical clocks, celestial motions; now by atomic clocks, setting UTC standard. Einstein's time dilation idea showed relativity based on velocity & gravity. Entropy may define time's arrow. Time travel is mainly fictional. Philosophical debates incl. A-theory & B-theory. Human perception varies by biology & psychology. Gregorian calendar is globally dominant.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Number</b>: mathematical objects for counting, measuring & labeling. Range from naturals (1, 2, 3, …) to complex (real & imaginary parts). Evolved from tally marks to include zero, negatives, rationals, irrationals (e.g., √2), & transcendentals (e.g., π). Greeks found irrationality, affecting geometry & infinite primes. Real numbers cover rationals & irrationals; complex solve equations without real solutions. Primes divisible only by 1 & themselves. Concepts: cardinality & different infinities. Cultural significance & numerology influenced ancient views.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Meaning</b>: significance, definition, and purpose. Studied via linguistics (words & language meaning), philosophy (existentialism & hermeneutics), art & religion (symbols & interpretations). Context shapes interpretation & understanding of meaning. Cultural norms & societal changes impact the construction & interpretation of it. Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (proposes that language affects perception). Central to cognition, identity, decisions, and well-being. Drives human progress and development. Issues: digitalization on authenticity, globalisation, AI.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Ethics</b>: philosophy branch studying right & wrong behaviour, moral principles, values. Key areas: normative (moral actions & principles), applied (moral obligations & issues), meta-ethics (nature & foundations of moral propositions). Key concepts & theories: deontological (duties & rules), consequentialism (eg, utilitarianism; outcomes), virtue (character). Ancient origins; shaped by Kant, Mill, etc. Guides personal behaviour, societal norms, & professional conduct (medicine, law, business). New challenges from tech & global concerns. Future topics: AI bias, biotech, privacy, climate justice.
  </p>



  <p>
    <b>Logic</b>: study of reasoning, esp. valid inference & correct argumentation. Key idea: premises leading to conclusions by inference rules. Types: formal (propositional, predicate), informal (regarding fallacies & critical thinking); deductive (airtight conclusions) or ampliative (inductive or abductive generalisations). Origins: Ancient Greeks -> modern developments by Frege -> limitations by Gödel’s theorems. Uses: CS (esp. AI), maths, philosophy. Key Issues: Handling of paradoxes, advances in quantum logic, AI reasoning (eg, smart contracts).
