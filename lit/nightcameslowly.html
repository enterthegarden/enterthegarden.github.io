  THE NIGHT CAME SLOWLY
  </div>
  by Kate Chopin (1850)

  <br>
  <br>

  <div class="story">
  I am losing my interest in human beings; in the significance of their lives and their actions. Some one has said it is better to study one man than ten books. I want neither books nor men; they make me suffer. Can one of them talk to me like the night – the Summer night? Like the stars or the caressing wind?
  <br><br>
  The night came slowly, softly, as I lay out there under the maple tree.
  <br><br>
  It came creeping, creeping stealthily out of the valley, thinking I did not notice.
  <br><br>
  And the outlines of trees and foliage nearby blended in one black mass and the night came stealing out from them, too,
  <br><br>
  and from the east and west, until the only light was in the sky, filtering through the maple leaves and a star looking down through every cranny.
  <br><br>
  The night is solemn and it means mystery.
  <br><br>
  Human shapes flitted by like intangible things. Some stole up like little mice to peep at me. I did not mind. My whole being was abandoned to the soothing and penetrating charm of the night.
  <br><br>
  The katydids began their slumber song: they are at it yet.
  <br><br>
  How wise they are. They do not chatter like people. They tell me only: “sleep, sleep, sleep.” The wind rippled the maple leaves like little warm love thrills.
  <br><br>
  Why do fools cumber the Earth! It was a man’s voice that broke the necromancer’s spell. A man came to-day with his “Bible Class.” He is detestable with his red cheeks and bold eyes and coarse manner and speech. What does he know of Christ? Shall I ask a young fool who was born yesterday and will die tomorrow to tell me things of Christ? I would rather ask the stars: they have seen him.
