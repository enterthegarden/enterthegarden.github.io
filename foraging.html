    Heading into the wilderness? Prepare yourself. You must learn about the weather, wildlife, and hazards you'll be facing. Tell someone your plans and return time. Pack fire equipment, water purifying tools, and a reliable knife. You’ll also need a first-aid kit, a compass, and a map. Once you’re there, set up a shelter. One bad night against the elements can kill you. Position your shelter away from the rain and wind. Insulate the ground you’ll be sleeping on with dry leaves in a log frame. Cover the shelter with leaves and debris one finger thick. Next, you’ll need fire. Lighters, flints, and matches. Keep your fire starters dry. Have redundancies. Put tinder under a teepee of small twigs to get it going. Maintain it with fuel in a circle of dry rocks. Never leave it unattended. That’s shelter and fire done. Now to get water. Find running water, rainwater, or dew. Filter it, then boil it — get a rolling boil going for one minute straight. Drink it when you’re thirsty. Now to get out of there: Make a note of natural landmarks, and learn to use your compass, or you’ll circle and get lost. Carry a whistle and a mirror (3 blows or flashes signals distress. Think: SOS). To make a smoke signal, put leaves and damp wood in your fire. If you’re stuck, you’ll need food. Use a plant guide, but be extremely careful. It’s better to hunt. Fish, eggs, small animals. Trap them. Catch them. Remove the insides, and cook them. Waste no movement. Stay positive. Adapt and you will overcome.

  <div class="story">


  <p>
    <b><a id="swimming">Wild Swimming</a></b>: Swim outdoors with company, visibility, and be ready for an emergency. Before you head out, choose your swimming spot. Look for hazards. Check the water conditions and weather reports. If the currents are dangerous or the forecast is poor, don't risk it. Beginners must never swim alone. Go in a group and watch each other's backs. All of you must take the right gear - a bright swimming cap, a wet suit, and a tow float if you need it. Get ready for emergencies, too. Have a plan to call for help. Take a whistle and a phone in a waterproof pouch. Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. When you're at the waterside, enter the water slowly. It lets your body adjust to the temperature. If you jump or dive without first checking how deep it is or what's under there, then that could mean a broken leg, which is gameover. Swim parallel to the shore. Know your limits and abilities. And above all else, know how to float to rest. If a current takes you, the last thing you'll want is to spend all your energy. If you start shivering or you feel a sudden inner coldness, get out of the water. Hypothermia is no joke. Warm up gradually after swimming to avoid shocking your system. It goes without saying that you should respect the environment. That means don't disturb the wildlife, don't leave anything behind, and know the local regulations. By swimming with experienced swimmers, you'll learn the safe spots and what to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="climbing">Wild Tree Climbing</a></b>: Only climb sturdy trees, and do so keeping three points of contact. Humans are good climbers, but terrible fallers. One bad slip and there goes your ankle. So, choose your tree wisely. It must be sturdy, healthy, and have strong branches. Dead, rotten, or damaged trees are completely off-limits. Before you climb, inspect the tree and the surrounding area for hazards. Wear the right clothing. Long longwear and closed-toe shoes with good traction will prevent you slipping and protect your legs. Don't use loose clothing that could snag. Look up. You've got to plan your route up the tree. Look for strong branches that can support your weight. Use the 3 points of contact rule: keep two hands and one foot or two feet and one hand on the tree at all times for stability. You must test a branch to ensure it's really strong enough to hold your full weight. Use your legs to power up, not just your arms. This will reduce your fatigue and increase your efficiency. Keep your body close to the trunk to maintain balance. Don’t lean back or reach too far to the sides, as this could cause you to lose your balance. When you climb, take your time. Move slowly and deliberately to maintain control and secure yourself. To get down, climb down the same way you went up, using the planned route. Only use a new route if you really have to. And, of course, maintain three points of contact during the entire descent to ensure stability. Tree climbing is a skill that improves with practice. Continue to climb and learn from each experience. Have respect for the tree and its surrounding environment during your climb. It will make you a better climber.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="firemaking">Start & Maintain a Fire</a></b>: The routine goes - gather dry materials, light the tinder, gradually add fuel, and when you're done, extinguish it completely. Choose the right spot for your fire. Stay away from flammables and high winds. Don't set up under branches, because rising embers can catch them on fire. Clear the area to bare soil to prevent unintended fires. A rock circle also helps, but make sure the rocks you choose aren't from rivers. Gather dry materials. Start with tinder, such as small twigs, leaves and grass. Then collect kindling, which is larger sticks. And finally fuel wood, the largest pieces, which will sustain your fire. Avoid damp wood, because it's hard to burn and makes excess smoke. Arrange your materials effectively. Bundle the tinder in the centre, or arrange the kindling around it in a teepee, lean-to, or cross-hatch pattern with gaps for airflow. Don't smother the fire with too much wood. Overloading when the fire is small can block oxygen and kill the flames. Ignite the tinder using a match, lighter, or flint and steel. Direct the spark or flame to the tinder to start the fire. Gradually add kindling and fuel wood. Start with kindling and increase the size as the fire grows. Add fuel wood once you have a steady blaze. Maintain the fire by adding wood regularly. Manage the airflow and layout for an efficient burn. Never ever leave the fire unattended. When you're done, extinguish it completely. Douse it with water, stir the ashes, and ensure the embers are cool. Repeat if necessary. Fire is a tool. The greatest tool. Use it wisely and with respect.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="waterpurifying">Find & Purify Water:</a></b>: Find flowing water, then collect it, filter it, boil it, and let it settle. First, find a source of flowing water. That means streams, rivers, or springs. In fact, running water, rainwater, or morning dew will do. But, if you use the stagnant water in ponds or lakes, you're likely to get sick. Then pre-filter the water using a clean cloth or bandana to remove particles, sediment, and debris before purification. Now bring the water to a rolling boil for one minute to kill bacteria, viruses, and parasites. You'll need to boil it longer if your altitude is higher (e.g. 3 minutes if your altitude is 2000 metres). If you can't boil it, then chemically treat it. Use iodine or chlorine tablets or drops. Follow the instructions on the packet for the correct dose and contact time. Next, you'll have to properly filter it. Use a filter with a pore size of 0.2 microns or less to remove bacteria and protozoa. Then pump the water into a clean container. Let it sit for half an hour (in the shade), especially after chemical treatment. Now, are there other methods? Absolutely. You can get water from leaves, for example, by wrapping them in a plastic bag in the morning and returning in the evening. You can also build a 'solar water still'. The human body seems fragile. But, the truth is our ancestors were more connected to the land. We moderns take it for granted that we literally bathe in drinking water. Whereas knowledge of reliable water sources was central to our ancestors. They also had built up tolerances. And yet... they still contracted waterborne illnesses more often than us. So, use these tried and true techniques with gratitude.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="shelterbuilding">Build a Simple Shelter:</a></b>: Choose your location wisely. It must be flat, dry, and protected from wind and hazards like water flow, falling branches, and insect nests. Gather your materials. Sturdy, dry branches and natural materials like leaves, moss, and pine needles for the framework and insulation. Design and build your framework. Choose a lean-to or A-frame structure. Use natural features like trees and rocks for support. Long branches for the main ridgepole and angled smaller branches for support. Keep it simple! Insulate the base and shelter. Use dried leaves and pine needles on the ground and in the structure to be a barrier to cold and moisture. Cover the framework. Layer vegetation densely to protect against wind and rain. Use bark or woven branches to secure it. Ensure stability and size. Check the stability and reinforce as needed. Make it compact for heat retention, but spacious enough for entry and exit. Maintain your shelter. Replace wet or damaged materials. Patch holes. Ensure sturdiness and waterproofing. Test it before you rest! Your shelter is your lifeline. Build it right and it will protect you.

  <p>
    <b><a id="plantforaging">Plant Foraging</a></b>:  Identify the plants. Use reliable regional guides. Be 100% sure before eating. Start with a few easy, abundant species without toxic look-alikes. Know the edible parts and proper preparation for each plant. Avoid polluted areas. Toxins accumulate in plants. Clean and prepare properly. Cook if needed for safety and digestibility. With new species, eat small amounts first to test for allergies or sensitivity. Forage sustainably and where it's legal. Your knowledge is your power. Learn it, use it, and survive.

  </p>

  <p>
    <b><a id="trapsetting">Setting Traps</a></b>: Scout the area. Look for animal signs and place traps near natural funnels like fallen logs that guide movement. Choose trap types based on the target animal and environment. Simple snares, spring snares, deadfall traps. Gather natural materials that blend in. Flexible saplings, cordage or wire, sticks, logs. Construct simple snares. Create a noose with cordage, attach it to a stake or tree, position it over a game trail or burrow entrance. Camouflage the trap. Minimize disturbance and scent. Use mud, leaves, and branches to hide it. Set multiple traps to increase success. Check daily and dispatch caught animals humanely. Practice trap-making skills before needing them in a survival situation. Learn from each experience. Know local laws and regulations regarding trapping and hunting. Only use in true emergencies. Your traps are your tools. Master them and they will provide.

  </p>

  <p>
    <b><a id="plantanimalavoiding">Avoiding Plants & Animals</a></b>: Know your enemy. Learn to identify poisonous plants like poison ivy, oak, and sumac. Study their leaf shape, colour, and habitat. Wear protective clothing in dense vegetation. Long sleeves, pants, boots, and gloves. If you come in contact with a poisonous plant, rinse the area with water and soap or alcohol to remove the oils. Don't eat any plants, leaves, berries, or mushrooms unless you're 100% sure of their identification and edibility. Watch for signs of dangerous animals. Keep a safe distance, even if they seem docile, small, or cute. Don't feed wild animals. If you encounter a large predator, stay calm, look big, and back away slowly while facing the animal. Don't run. Avoid reaching into dark crevices, logs, or anywhere snakes and spiders may hide. Check with a stick first. Protect yourself from biting insects with clothing, repellent, and camp away from breeding grounds like stagnant water. Store and dispose of food waste properly to avoid attracting animals. Use bear-proof containers or hang food out of reach. Your awareness is your shield. Stay alert, stay alive.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="wildfoodpreparing">Cooking Game</a></b>: Field dress immediately after the kill. Remove entrails, organs, and excess blood. Avoid puncturing the gut or intestines to prevent meat contamination. Skin, pluck hide, feathers, scales in preparation. Rinse the carcass with clean water to remove dirt, debris, and blood. Butcher into manageable pieces. Remove the head, feet, and tail. Cut the body into legs, ribs, and back. Skewer the meat on a spit or green stick for roasting over hot coals, not direct flames. Cook thoroughly until not pink, juices run clear, and internal temperature is at least 165°F to kill bacteria and parasites. Practice good hygiene and sanitation when handling to prevent foodborne illness. Wash hands and tools frequently. Your game is your sustenance. Treat it with respect and it will nourish you.


  </p>


  <p>
    <b><a id="helpsignalling">Help Signalling</a></b>: Carry signal devices. A whistle, mirror, and flashlight. Tell someone your route and return time before your trip. Find an open area with visibility for rescuers. Hilltops, clearings, shore. Use the international distress signal of 3. Three whistle blasts, three fires in a triangle, three light flashes. Repeat. Build a large, smoky fire during the day with green vegetation. Use a bright fire at night for attention. Create ground-to-air signals with contrasting natural materials. Make a large SOS or X. Use a signal mirror to reflect sunlight and flash a beam. Wave bright clothing or flags. Conserve your signalling resources and energy. Use them moderately but consistently. Don't give up. If spotted by an aircraft, stay put. Guide rescuers by continuing to signal as needed. Maintain a positive attitude and think clearly. Avoid panic - it's a key survival skill. Never stop signalling. Your signals are your lifeline. Use them wisely and persistently.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="navigating">Navigating by Landmarks & Celestial Bodies</a></b>: Identify prominent landmarks. Mountains, rivers, unique rock formations. Use them as fixed points for orientation. Learn the basic positions and movements of celestial bodies. The sun rises in the East and sets in the West. The stars move from East to West across the sky. In the Northern Hemisphere, locate the North Star (Polaris) at night to find North. Polaris is almost directly above the North Pole. Learn key constellations like the Big Dipper, Orion, and Cassiopeia to help orient yourself. Use the stick and shadow method during the day to find East and West. Plant a stick vertically, mark the tip of the shadow, wait 15-30 minutes, then mark the new shadow tip position. The line between the marks runs from West to East. Observe the moon phases for directions. The first quarter moon rises at noon, sets at midnight, and its illuminated side faces West. The last quarter moon rises at midnight, sets at noon, and its illuminated side faces East. As you travel, create reference points by picking new landmarks and mentally noting them to maintain orientation and track your path. Practice navigation skills regularly in different environments and conditions to sharpen your abilities and build confidence. If you get lost, stay calm, find a high point to observe major landmarks, and reassess your orientation. Your navigation skills are your compass. Master them and you'll never be lost.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="toolmaking">Tool Making</a></b>: For <i>flintknapping</i>, Choose your stones wisely. Fine-grained, brittle, and without cracks and impurities. Flint, chert, obsidian, glass. Gather your tools. Hard and soft hammers, pressure flaker, leather pads, and safety gear. Create a striking platform. 80-90° with the hard hammer. Abrade if needed. Remove thinning flakes with a soft hammer, aiming through the center plane. Rotate and repeat on the opposite face. Refine the platform by abrading or flaking to 60° for optimal removal. Alternate flake removals on both faces toward the tip, maintaining a centered ridge and slight convexity. Switch to a pressure flaker when too thin for percussion. Apply pressure directly into the stone. Shape the final edge with short pressure flakes along the margins. Plan your removals for an even, sharp edge. Refine the overall shape and symmetry with final pressure flaking. Take your time for small corrections. Practice constantly with various stones. Learn from your mistakes and seek expert advice. Your flintknapping skills are your art. Hone them with patience and persistence.

    <br>
    <br>

    For <i>spear making</i>, select a straight, sturdy hardwood branch or sapling. Ash or oak, arm's length or longer, 1-1.5" diameter. Carefully remove the bark and knots from the shaft with a knife. Smooth it out. Carve one end into a sharp, centered point using even strokes with a knife. Harden the point by holding it over hot coals or embers until lightly charred for durability. Practice throwing at a target from various distances for accuracy. Use a fluid motion, power from your shoulder and waist. When hunting, be mindful of what's beyond your target. Never throw if a miss could endanger someone. Stalk the animal quietly, moving slowly and deliberately. Be aware of the wind direction to avoid your scent reaching the animal. Get close for a clean kill shot to the vitals. Or, remain still and concealed, allowing animals within range. Camouflage and minimize movement. After a hit, approach carefully but quickly to dispatch with a knife if needed. Recover your spear and track the blood trail. Maintain your spear by regularly inspecting, sharpening the tip, and checking the integrity of bindings or lashings. Your spear is your lifeline. Craft it with care and it will provide.

    <br>
    <br>

    For <i>making cordage</i>, choose strong, flexible plant fibers. Inner bark (cedar), tall grasses, stinging nettle, dogbane, yucca, agave. Harvest the fibers. Cut the plants close to the ground or pull off inner bark strips. Gather extra. Dry the fibers if needed for easier separation and handling. Remove the outer bark, leaves, stems, leaving only the stringy inner fibers. Separate into thin, even strands for strength. Divide into 2 bundles. Twist each bundle consistently in 1 direction for tensile strength. Bring the twisted bundles together, let them wrap around each other in the opposite direction. Continue twisting the individual bundles and wrapping. Tighter twists equal stronger cordage. Splice in new fibers at the end by overlapping with existing bundles, continue twisting. Finish by knotting or tucking the ends into the twists. Test the strength and flexibility before use. Your cordage is your connection. Master the craft and it will tie your survival together.
