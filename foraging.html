    Heading into the wilderness? Prepare yourself. You must learn about the weather, wildlife, and hazards you'll be facing. Tell someone your plans and return time. Pack fire equipment, water purifying tools, and a reliable knife. You’ll also need a first-aid kit, a compass, and a map. Once you’re there, set up a shelter. One bad night against the elements can kill you. Position your shelter away from the rain and wind. Insulate the ground you’ll be sleeping on with dry leaves in a log frame. Cover the shelter with leaves and debris one finger thick. Next, you’ll need fire. Lighters, flints, and matches. Keep your fire starters dry. Have redundancies. Put tinder under a teepee of small twigs to get it going. Maintain it with fuel in a circle of dry rocks. Never leave it unattended. That’s shelter and fire done. Now to get water. Find running water, rainwater, or dew. Filter it, then boil it — get a rolling boil going for one minute straight. Drink it when you’re thirsty. Now to get out of there: Make a note of natural landmarks, and learn to use your compass, or you’ll circle and get lost. Carry a whistle and a mirror (3 blows or flashes signals distress. Think: SOS). To make a smoke signal, put leaves and damp wood in your fire. If you’re stuck, you’ll need food. Use a plant guide, but be extremely careful. It’s better to hunt. Fish, eggs, small animals. Trap them. Catch them. Remove the insides, and cook them. Waste no movement. Stay positive. Adapt and you will overcome.

  <b><i>Further Notes...</i></b>
</div>

  <div class="story">


  <p>
    <b><a id="swimming">Wild Swimming</a></b>: Choose a safe spot & assess water conditions. Avoid hazards, check weather reports. Never swim alone, and watch each other. Check weather & tides. Avoid if forecast’s poor or dangerous currents. Conditions can change quickly. Enter water slowly to acclimate to temp. Don't jump/dive w/o checking depth & obstructions. Wear appropriate gear for visibility & protection (bright swim cap, wetsuit, tow float if needed). Stay within limits & abilities. Swim parallel to shore, not too far out. Be conservative w/ distance & duration. Be prepared for emergencies. Have plan to call for help (whistle, phone in waterproof pouch). Know how to float to rest. Exit water if shivering or too cold to avoid hypothermia. Warm up gradually. Respect the environment & local regulations. Don't disturb wildlife or leave anything. Swim w/ experienced others to learn safe spots & get tips as you build skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="climbing">Wild Tree Climbing</a></b>: Select sturdy, healthy tree w/ strong branches. Avoid dead, rotten, damaged trees. Inspect tree & surrounding area for hazards before climbing. Wear appropriate clothing - long pants, closed-toe shoes w/ good traction. Avoid loose clothing that could snag. Plan route up tree, look for strong branches that can support weight. Use 3 points of contact rule - keep 2 hands & 1 foot or 2 feet & 1 hand on tree at all times for stability. Use legs to power up, don't just pull w/ arms. Test branches before putting full weight on them. Keep body close to trunk. Don't lean back or reach too far to sides. Take time, move slowly & deliberately. Don't climb higher than comfortable. To descend, climb down same way as up, maintaining 3 points of contact.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="firemaking">Start & Maintain a Fire</a></b>: Select safe spot & prep site: away from flammables & high winds, not under branches. Clear to bare soil & use a rock circle if possible. Gather dry materials: tinder (small twigs, leaves, grass), kindling (larger sticks), or fuel wood (largest pieces). Avoid damp wood (hard to burn, makes smoke). Arrange the materials: Bundle tinder in the centre, or kindling around in teepee, lean-to, or cross-hatch w/ gaps for air. Avoid smothering w/ too much wood (overloading, esp. when small, blocks O2 & kills flames). Ignite tinder: Use a match, lighter, or flint & steel. Direct the spark/flame to the tinder. Gradually add kindling & fuel wood: Start w/ kindling, increase size as fire grows. Add fuel wood once a steady blaze. Maintain the fire: Add wood regularly, manage airflow & layout for an efficient burn. Never leave it. When done, extinguish completely: Douse w/ water, stir ashes, ensure embers cool. Repeat if needed.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="waterpurifying">Find & Purify Water:</a></b>: Locate source: opt for flowing water (streams, rivers, springs) over stagnant (ponds, lakes). Pre-filter: use clean cloth/filter/bandana to remove particles, sediment & debris pre-purification. Boil: bring to rolling boil for 1 min (3 min above 6,500 ft) to kill bacteria, viruses & parasites. Chemically treat: if you can't boil, use iodine/chlorine tablets/drops per instructions for dose & contact time. Filter: use 0.2 micron or smaller pore size to remove bacteria & protozoa, and pump into a clean container. Settle: let sit for 30+ min post-chemical treatment for effectiveness pre-drinking.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="shelterbuilding">Build a Simple Shelter:</a></b>: Choose Location: flat, dry, protected from wind & hazards (e.g. water flow, falling branches, insect nests). Gather Materials: sturdy, dry branches & natural materials (like leaves, moss, pine needles) for framework & insulation. Design & Build Framework: Choose a lean-to or A-frame structure using natural features (trees, rocks) for support; long branches for a main ridgepole & angled smaller branches for support. Keep it simple! Insulate Base & Shelter: use dried leaves/pine needles on the ground & in the structure to be a barrier to cold & moisture. Cover Framework: layer vegetation densely to protect against wind & rain; use bark/woven branches to secure it. Ensure Stability & Size: check stability, reinforce as needed; make it compact for heat retention, but spacious enough for entry/exit. Maintain Shelter: replace wet/damaged materials, patch holes, ensure sturdiness & waterproofing. Test before you rest!

  </p>


  <p>
    <b><a id="trapsetting">Setting Traps</a></b>: Scout area: Look for animal signs & place traps near natural funnels (fallen logs) that guide movement. Choose trap types based on target animal & environment (e.g. simple snares, spring snares, deadfall traps). Gather natural materials that blend in (flexible saplings, cordage/wire, sticks, logs). Construct simple snares: Create noose w/ cordage, attach to stake/tree, position over game trail/burrow entrance. Camouflage trap: Minimize disturbance & scent, use mud, leaves, branches to hide. Set multiple traps to increase success. Check daily & dispatch caught animals humanely. Practice trap-making skills before needing in survival situation. Learn from each experience. Know local laws & regulations re: trapping & hunting. Only use in true emergencies.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="plantforaging">Plant Foraging</a></b>: Identify plants: use reliable regional guides (be 100% sure before eating). Start with a few easy, abundant species without toxic look-alikes. Know the edible parts & proper prep for each plant. Avoid polluted areas, as toxins accumulate in plants. Clean & prep properly: Cook if needed for safety & digestibility. With new species: eat small amounts first to test allergies/sensitivity. (Generally, forage sustainably and where it’s legal.)

  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="plantanimalavoiding">Avoiding Plants & Animals</a></b>: ID poisonous plants (poison ivy/oak/sumac), so learn leaf shape, colour, habitat. Wear protective clothing (long sleeves, pants, boots, gloves) in dense vegetation. If contact w/ poisonous plant, rinse area w/ water & soap/alcohol to remove oils. Don't eat plants (leaves, berries, mushrooms) unless 100% sure of ID & edibility. Watch for signs of dangerous animals. Keep safe distance, even if they seem docile/small/cute. Don’t feed wild animals. If encountering large predator, stay calm, look big, back away slowly facing animal. Don't run. Avoid reaching in dark crevices, logs, etc. where snakes/spiders may hide. Check w/ stick first. Protect from biting insects w/ clothing, repellent, & camp away from breeding grounds (stagnant water). Store & dispose of food waste properly to avoid attracting animals. Use bear-proof containers or hang out of reach.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="wildfoodpreparing">Cooking Game</a></b>: Field dress ASAP post-kill. Remove entrails, organs, & excess blood. Avoid puncturing gut/intestines to prevent meat contamination. Skin/pluck hide, feathers, scales in prep. Rinse carcass w/ clean H2O to remove dirt, debris, blood. Butcher into manageable pieces: remove head, feet, tail; cut body into legs, ribs, back. Skewer meat on spit/green stick for roasting over hot coals (not direct flames). Cook thoroughly until not pink, juices run clear, internal temp ≥165°F to kill bacteria & parasites. Practise good hygiene & sanitation when handling to prevent foodborne illness. Wash hands & tools frequently.

  </p>


  <p>
    <b><a id="helpsignalling">Help Signalling</a></b>: Carry signal devices: whistle, mirror, flashlight. Tell route & return time pre-trip. Find open area w/ visibility for rescuers: hilltops, clearings, shore. Use intl. distress signal of 3 - whistle blasts, fires in triangle, light flashes. Repeat. Build large, smoky fire in day w/ green vegetation. Use bright fire at night for attn. Create ground-to-air signals w/ contrasting natural materials. Make large SOS or X. Use signal mirror to reflect sunlight & flash beam. Wave bright clothing/flags. Conserve signaling resources & energy. Use moderately but consistently. Don't give up. If spotted by aircraft, stay put. Guide rescuers by continuing to signal as needed. Maintain +ve attitude & think clearly. Avoid panic - a key survival skill. Never stop signaling.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="navigating">Navigating by Landmarks & Celestial Bodies</a></b>: ID prominent landmarks (mountains, rivers, unique rock formations) & use as fixed points for orientation. Learn basic positions & movements of celestial bodies. Sun rises E, sets W; stars move E to W across sky. In N Hemisphere, locate N Star (Polaris) at night to find N. Polaris almost directly above N Pole. Learn key constellations (Big Dipper, Orion, Cassiopeia) to help orient. Use stick & shadow method during day to find E-W. Plant stick vertically, mark tip of shadow, wait 15-30 min, mark new shadow tip position. Line between marks runs W to E. Observe moon phases for directions. 1st quarter moon rises noon, sets midnight, illuminated side facing W. Last quarter moon rises midnight, sets noon, illuminated side facing E. As you travel, create reference points by picking new landmarks & mentally noting them to maintain orientation & track path. Practice navigation skills regularly in different environments & conditions to sharpen abilities & build confidence. If lost, stay calm, find high point to observe major landmarks, reassess orientation.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="toolmaking">Tool Making</a></b>: Huge number of tools. For spear making, select a straight, sturdy hardwood branch/sapling (ash/oak), arm's length or longer, 1-1.5" diameter. Carefully remove bark & knots from shaft w/ knife. Smooth out. Carve one end into a sharp, centered point using even strokes w/ knife. Harden point by holding over hot coals/embers until lightly charred for durability. Practice throwing at target from various distances for accuracy. Use fluid motion, power from shoulder & waist. When hunting, be mindful of what's beyond target. Never throw if miss could endanger someone. Stalk animal quietly, moving slowly & deliberately. Be aware of wind direction to avoid scent reaching animal. Get close for clean kill shot to vitals. Or, remain still & concealed, allowing animals within range. Camouflage & minimize movement. After hit, approach carefully but quickly to dispatch w/ knife if needed. Recover spear & track blood trail. Maintain spear by regularly inspecting, sharpening tip, & checking integrity of bindings/lashings.
