    Heading into the wilderness? Prepare yourself. You must learn about the weather, wildlife, and hazards you'll be facing. Tell someone your plans and return time. Pack fire equipment, water purifying tools, and a reliable knife. You’ll also need a first-aid kit, a compass, and a map. Once you’re there, set up a shelter. One bad night against the elements can kill you. Position your shelter away from the rain and wind. Insulate the ground you’ll be sleeping on with dry leaves in a log frame. Cover the shelter with leaves and debris one finger thick. Next, you’ll need fire. Lighters, flints, and matches. Keep your fire starters dry. Have redundancies. Put tinder under a teepee of small twigs to get it going. Maintain it with fuel in a circle of dry rocks. Never leave it unattended. That’s shelter and fire done. Now to get water. Find running water, rainwater, or dew. Filter it, then boil it — get a rolling boil going for one minute straight. Drink it when you’re thirsty. Now to get out of there: Make a note of natural landmarks, and learn to use your compass, or you’ll circle and get lost. Carry a whistle and a mirror (3 blows or flashes signals distress. Think: SOS). To make a smoke signal, put leaves and damp wood in your fire. If you’re stuck, you’ll need food. Use a plant guide, but be extremely careful. It’s better to hunt. Fish, eggs, small animals. Trap them. Catch them. Remove the insides, and cook them. Waste no movement. Stay positive. Adapt and you will overcome.

  <p>
    <b><a id="swimming">Wild Swimming</a></b>: <span class="summary">To swim outdoors, do it with company, visibility, and be ready for an emergency.</span> Now, before you head out, choose your swimming spot. Look for hazards. Check the water conditions and weather reports. If the currents are dangerous or the forecast is poor, don't risk it. Beginners must never swim alone. Go in a group and watch each other's backs. All of you must take the right gear - a bright swimming cap, a wet suit, and a tow float if you need it. Get ready for emergencies too. Have a plan to call for help. Take a whistle and a phone in a waterproof pouch. Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. When you're at the waterside, enter the water slowly. It lets your body adjust to the temperature. If you jump or dive without first checking how deep it is or what's under there, then that could mean a broken leg, which is gameover. Swim parallel to the shore. Know your limits and abilities. And above all else, know how to float to rest. If a current takes you, the last thing you'll want is to spend all your energy thrashing. If you start shivering or you feel a sudden inner coldness, get out of the water. Hypothermia is no joke. Warm up gradually after swimming to avoid shocking your system. It goes without saying that you should respect the environment. That means don't disturb the wildlife, don't leave anything behind, and know the local regulations. By swimming with experienced swimmers, you'll learn the safe spots and exactly what to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="climbing">Wild Tree Climbing</a></b>: <span class="summary">To climb trees, pick the sturdy ones, and always keep three points of contact while climbing.</span> Humans are good climbers, but terrible fallers. One bad slip and there goes your ankle. So, choose your tree wisely. It must be sturdy, healthy, and have strong branches. Dead, rotten, or damaged trees are completely off-limits. Before you climb, inspect the tree and the surrounding area for hazards. Wear the right clothing. Long longwear and closed-toe shoes with good traction will prevent you slipping and protect your legs. Don't use loose clothing that could snag. Use durable and protective clothing. Now look up at the tree, because you've got to plan your route up the tree. Look for strong branches that can support your weight. Use the 3 points of contact rule: keep two hands and one foot or two feet and one hand on the tree at all times for stability. You must test a branch to ensure it's really strong enough to hold your full weight. Use your legs to power up, not just your arms. This will reduce your fatigue and increase your efficiency. Keep your body close to the trunk to maintain balance. Don’t lean back or reach too far to the sides, as this could cause you to lose your balance. When you climb, take your time. Move slowly and deliberately to maintain control and secure yourself. To get down, climb down the same way you went up, using the planned route. Only use a new route if you really have to. And, of course, maintain three points of contact during the entire descent to ensure stability. Tree climbing is a skill that like all skills improves with practice. Continue to climb and learn from each experience. And I expect you to have respect for the tree and its surrounding environment during your climb.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="firemaking">Make & Maintain a Fire</a></b>: <span class="summary">For fire-making, the routine goes - gather dry materials, light the tinder, gradually add fuel, and when you're done, extinguish it completely.</span> Now the details. First, choose the right spot for your fire. Stay away from flammables and high winds. Don't set up under branches, because rising embers can catch them on fire. Clear the area to bare soil to prevent unintended fires. A rock circle also helps, but make sure the rocks you choose aren't from rivers (as those contain trapped water and can explode). Gather dry materials. Start with tinder, such as small twigs, leaves and grass. Then collect kindling, which is larger sticks. And finally fuel wood, which are the largest pieces, which will sustain your fire. Avoid damp wood, because it's hard to burn and makes excess smoke. Arrange your materials effectively. Bundle the tinder in the centre, or arrange the kindling around it in a teepee, lean-to, or cross-hatch pattern with gaps for airflow. Don't smother the fire with too much wood. Overloading when the fire is small can block oxygen and kill the flames. Ignite the tinder using a match, lighter, or flint and steel. Direct the spark to the tinder to start the fire. Gradually add kindling and fuel wood. Start with kindling and increase the size as the fire grows. Add fuel wood once you have a steady blaze. Maintain the fire by adding wood regularly. You’ll also want to manage the airflow and layout for an efficient burn. Never ever leave the fire unattended. When you're done, extinguish it completely. Douse it with water, stir the ashes, and ensure the embers are cool. Repeat if necessary. Fire is a tool. Some say the first tool. Some say the greatest tool. Use it wisely and with respect.

    <b><a id="waterpurifying">Find & Purify Water</a></b>: <span class="summary">To get water in the wild, first find flowing water, then collect it, filter it, boil it, and let it settle.</span> More precisely, first find a source of flowing water. That means streams, rivers, or springs. In fact, running water, rainwater, or morning dew will do. But, if you use the stagnant water in ponds or lakes, you're likely to get sick. Then pre-filter the water using a clean cloth or bandana to remove particles, sediment, and debris before purification. Now bring the water to a rolling boil for one minute to kill bacteria, viruses, and parasites. You'll need to boil it longer if your altitude is higher (e.g. 3 minutes if your altitude is 2000 metres or more). If you can't boil it, then chemically treat it. Use iodine or chlorine tablets or drops. Follow the instructions on the packet for the correct dose and contact time. Next, you'll have to properly filter it. Use a filter with a pore size of 0.2 microns or less to remove bacteria and protozoa. Then pump the water into a clean container. Let it sit for half an hour in the shade, especially after chemical treatment. Now, are there other methods? Absolutely. You can get water from leaves, for example, by wrapping them in a plastic bag in the morning and returning in the evening. You can also build a 'solar water still'. The human body seems fragile. But, the truth is our ancestors were more connected to the land. We moderns take it for granted that we literally bathe in drinking water. Whereas knowledge of reliable water sources was central to our ancestors. They also had built up tolerances. And yet... they still contracted waterborne illnesses more often than us. So, use these tried and true techniques with gratitude.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="shelterbuilding">Build a Simple Shelter</a></b>: <span class="summary">To make an outdoor shelter, choose a dry, flat, and secure spot, insulate the ground, build the shelter, insulate the shelter, then test it before you rest in it.</span> To be specific, first, find a flat and dry spot which is protected from wind and hazards like water flow, falling branches, and insect nests. Next, gather up your materials. Sturdy and dry branches will form the framework. Leaves, moss, and pine needles - the insulation. Drop leaves all around on the ground, so you don't freeze to death (the ground at night is fantastic at stealing your body heat). Choose a lean-to or A-frame structure for your framework. Use natural features like trees and rocks for overall support. Long branches for the main ridgepole and angled smaller branches for framework support. Keep it simple! Insulate the base and shelter. Use dried leaves and pine needles on the ground and in the structure to be a barrier to cold and moisture. Cover the framework. Layer vegetation densely to protect against wind and rain. One finger thick ought to do it. Use bark or woven branches to secure it. Check its stability and reinforce as needed. Make it compact for heat retention, but spacious enough for entry and exit. Unlike houses, you'll have to frequently maintain it. That means replacing wet or damaged materials, patching holes, and, of course, ensuring it's sturdy and waterproof. Remember: Test it before you rest in it! One bad night unsheltered in the elements can literally kill you, so do it right.

  <p>
    <b><a id="plantforaging">Plant Foraging</a></b>: <span class="summary">To forage for wild plants, use reliable guides, learn which specific parts are edible, and always test small amounts of any new plants.</span> Get a guide with high quality photos or illustrations. If it also tells you and shows you toxic look-alikes that's another sign of a good guide. But, regardless of how reliable your regional guide is, you'll want to basically be 100% sure before you eat anything. So, start with a few easy, abundant species without toxic look-alikes. Know the edible parts and proper preparation for each plant. Focus on seasonal availability; many plants are most nutritious and safest to consume when gathered at the right time of year. Avoid polluted areas, because toxins accumulate in plants. Clean the plant and prepare it  properly. Cook it if you have to for safety and digestibility. Always perform a sensitivity test by rubbing part of the plant on your skin before consuming to check for adverse reactions. With new species, eat small amounts first to test for allergies or sensitivity. If you can, then document your finds with photos and notes for future reference, especially when experimenting with unfamiliar plants. In a survival situation, the story is different, but otherwise do it sustainably and where it's legal. Teach others about your findings and experiences, especially bad ones.

  <p>
    <b><a id="trapsetting">Setting Traps</a></b>: <span class="summary">To trap wild animals, you'll need to set traps near signs of animals, using natural materials, camouflage them well, check them daily, and dispatch caught animals humanely.</span> Look for animal signs and place traps near natural funnels like fallen logs that guide movement. Choose trap types based on the target animal and environment. Simple snares, spring snares, deadfall traps - learn how to make all of these. Gather natural materials that blend in. Flexible saplings, cordage or wire, sticks, logs. You'll start out with constructing simple snares. Create a noose with cordage, attach it to a stake or tree, position it over a game trail or burrow entrance. Camouflage the trap. Use gloves to handle materials and set traps to minimise human scent, which can deter animals. Use mud, leaves, and branches to hide it. If you set multiple traps, you'll increase your chances of success. Check them daily and dispatch any caught animals you won't be eating humanely. Ensure all traps are anchored securely to prevent escape and avoid causing unnecessary suffering to the animal. True, you will be eating it to survive, but have standards. Regularly maintain and inspect your traps for wear and tear to ensure they function correctly when needed. Of course, you'll want to practise trap-making skills before needing them in a survival situation. Because by then, frankly speaking, it's too late. Learn from each experience. Study the behaviour and daily routines of your target species to determine the optimal time and place for setting your traps. Also, look up and learn the local laws and regulations regarding trapping and hunting. Last thing you need is trouble with the law.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="wildfoodpreparing">Cooking Game</a></b>: <span class="summary">Once you've caught game, remove its entrails immediately, then later on butcher it, rinse it with clean water, cook it thoroughly, and be hygienic throughout.</span> By field dressing immediately after the kill, you help the carcass cool quicker and reduce bacterial growth. The incisions you make will depend on the animal, but in general make a precise cut from the breastbone to the pelvis, remove all organs carefully to avoid rupture, and thoroughly clean the cavity. Avoid puncturing the gut or intestines to prevent contaminating the meat. Dispose of any offal responsibly, far away from your campsite to avoid attracting predators or pests. It has the added bonus of making the carcass lighter for transport. Remove the skin, or the scales, or pluck the feathers - whichever applies. Rinse the carcass with clean water to remove dirt, debris, and blood. Then butcher it into manageable pieces. Remove the head, feet, and tail. Cut the body into its legs, ribs, and back. Skewer the meat on a spit or green stick for roasting over hot coals, and not direct flames because this will charr the meat. Needless to say, the spit or stick should be able to handle the heat. Cook it thoroughly until the flesh is not pink and its juices run clear. Its internal temperature should be at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit (or 75 degrees Celsius) to kill bacteria and parasites. Maintain strict hygiene and sanitation when handling these things to prevent foodborne illness. Wash your hands and your tools frequently. Trust me. Bacteria is waiting for you to let your guard down and render you out of action. So, clean your hands after each major step in the butchering process to avoid cross-contamination. Your game is your sustenance.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><a id="plantanimalavoiding">Avoiding Plants & Animals</a></b>: <span class="summary">Know exactly which plants are poisonous, exactly which animals are predacious, and always wear protective clothing.</span> You'll need to learn to identify poisonous plants in your area (like poison ivy, oak, and sumac). Study their leaf shape, colour, and habitat. In any dense vegetation, Wear protective clothing. Long sleeves, pants, boots, and gloves. If you come in contact with a poisonous plant, rinse the area with water and soap or alcohol to remove the oils. Don't eat any plants, leaves, berries, or mushrooms unless you're 100% sure of their identification and edibility. Watch for signs of dangerous animals. Keep a safe distance, even if they seem docile, small, or cute. Don't feed wild animals. By the way, even if they are friendly, you're not doing them a favour. If you encounter a large predator, stay calm, look big, and back away slowly while facing the animal. Don't run. Avoid reaching into dark crevices, logs, or anywhere snakes and spiders may hide. If they bite you, you might not even see which kind of snake it was. So, at least check it with a stick first. Protect yourself from biting insects with selective clothing, repellent, and camp away from breeding grounds like stagnant water. Store and dispose of food waste properly to avoid attracting animals. Use bear-proof containers or hang food well out of reach. Stay alert, stay alive.

    <b><a id="helpsignalling">Help Signalling</a></b>: <span class="summary">Use a whistle, mirror, and flashlight to signal distress, build smoky fires, use the three-signal principle: whistle in threes, flash a light in threes, and make smoky fires in threes.</span> Signalling devices like a whistle, mirror, and flashlight are dirt cheap and highly portable. You can store a credit card sized mirror in your wallet, and a flashlight on your keychain. Tell someone your route and return time before your trip. When you get stuck, find an open area with visibility for rescuers. That means hilltops, clearings, or near the shore. Use the international distress signal of 3. Three whistle blasts, three fires in a triangle, or three light flashes. Repeat. Again and again. Would you investigate a single whistle blast? No? That's why I say: Repeat. Again and again. Build a large, smoky fire during the day with green vegetation. But, use a very bright fire at night for attention. Create ground-to-air signals with contrasting natural materials (like dark logs and light sand). Make a large X or a large SOS. Use a signal mirror to reflect sunlight and flash a beam. Wave bright clothing or flags. You should have a piece of bright clothing going out. Of course, conserve your signalling resources and energy. Use them moderately but consistently. Don't give up. If you've been spotted by an aircraft, stay put. Guide rescuers by continuing to signal as needed. Overall, maintain a positive attitude and think clearly. It's safe to say that almost no good decisions are made while panicking. Apply that to a survival situation, and you get the idea. Good luck.

  <p>
    <b><a id="navigating">Navigating by Landmarks & Celestial Bodies</a></b>: <span class="summary">To navigate the land, find landmarks, use the Sun and stars, the stick and shadow method, and stay calm.</span> The prominent landmarks will be mountains, rivers, and unique rock formations. Use them as fixed points for orientation. Carry a reliable compass and detailed topographical map of the area to cross-reference with natural landmarks for more accurate navigation. You'll need to learn the basic positions and movements of celestial bodies. The sun rises in the East and sets in the West. And, of course, the stars move from East to West across the sky. In the Northern Hemisphere, you'll need to know how to locate the North Star (Polaris) at night to find North. Polaris is almost directly above the North Pole. Learn key constellations like the Big Dipper, Orion, and Cassiopeia to help orient yourself. Use the stick and shadow method during the day to find East and West. Plant a stick vertically, mark the tip of the shadow, wait 15-30 minutes, then mark the new shadow tip position. The line between the marks runs from West to East. Observe the moon phases for directions. The first quarter moon rises at noon, sets at midnight, and its illuminated side faces West. The last quarter moon rises at midnight, sets at noon, and its illuminated side faces East. As you travel, create reference points by picking new landmarks and mentally noting them to maintain orientation and track your path. If you get lost, stay calm, find a high point to observe major landmarks, and reassess your orientation. Identify water flow direction in rivers and streams; water typically flows from higher to lower elevations and can guide you towards larger bodies of water or settlements. In day to day life, learn to live without a GPS and take different routes to never lose your sense of direction.

  <p>
    <b><a id="toolmaking">Tool Making</a></b>: <span class="summary">Toolmaking in nature is highly skilled, so I'll just say the absolute basics.</span>

    <br>
    <br>

    For <i>flintknapping</i>, Choose your stones wisely. Fine-grained, brittle, and without cracks and impurities. Flint, chert, obsidian, glass. Gather your tools. Hard and soft hammers, pressure flaker, leather pads, and safety gear. Create a striking platform. 80-90° with the hard hammer. Abrade if needed. Remove thinning flakes with a soft hammer, aiming through the center plane. Rotate and repeat on the opposite face. Refine the platform by abrading or flaking to 60° for optimal removal. Alternate flake removals on both faces toward the tip, maintaining a centered ridge and slight convexity. Switch to a pressure flaker when too thin for percussion. Apply pressure directly into the stone. Shape the final edge with short pressure flakes along the margins. Plan your removals for an even, sharp edge. Refine the overall shape and symmetry with final pressure flaking. Take your time for small corrections. Practice constantly with various stones. Learn from your mistakes and seek expert advice. Your flintknapping skills are your art. Hone them with patience and persistence.

    <br>
    <br>

    For <i>spear making</i>, select a straight, sturdy hardwood branch or sapling. Ash or oak, arm's length or longer, 1-1.5" diameter. Carefully remove the bark and knots from the shaft with a knife. Smooth it out. Carve one end into a sharp, centered point using even strokes with a knife. Harden the point by holding it over hot coals or embers until lightly charred for durability. Practice throwing at a target from various distances for accuracy. Use a fluid motion, power from your shoulder and waist. When hunting, be mindful of what's beyond your target. Never throw if a miss could endanger someone. Stalk the animal quietly, moving slowly and deliberately. Be aware of the wind direction to avoid your scent reaching the animal. Get close for a clean kill shot to the vitals. Or, remain still and concealed, allowing animals within range. Camouflage and minimize movement. After a hit, approach carefully but quickly to dispatch with a knife if needed. Recover your spear and track the blood trail. Maintain your spear by regularly inspecting, sharpening the tip, and checking the integrity of bindings or lashings. Your spear is your lifeline. Craft it with care and it will provide.

    <br>
    <br>

    For <i>making cordage</i>, choose strong, flexible plant fibers. Inner bark (cedar), tall grasses, stinging nettle, dogbane, yucca, agave. Harvest the fibers. Cut the plants close to the ground or pull off inner bark strips. Gather extra. Dry the fibers if needed for easier separation and handling. Remove the outer bark, leaves, stems, leaving only the stringy inner fibers. Separate into thin, even strands for strength. Divide into 2 bundles. Twist each bundle consistently in 1 direction for tensile strength. Bring the twisted bundles together, let them wrap around each other in the opposite direction. Continue twisting the individual bundles and wrapping. Tighter twists equal stronger cordage. Splice in new fibers at the end by overlapping with existing bundles, continue twisting. Finish by knotting or tucking the ends into the twists. Test the strength and flexibility before use. Your cordage is your connection. Master the craft and it will tie your survival together.
