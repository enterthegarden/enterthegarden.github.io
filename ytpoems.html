== TITLE ==
In A Station Of The Metro
== POET ==
Ezra Pound
== POEM ==
The apparition of these faces in the crowd; 
petals on a wet, black bough.

== TITLE ==
Dreams
== POET ==
Robert Herrick
== POEM ==
Here we are all, by day; by night we're hurl'd
By dreams, each one into a several world.

== TITLE ==
"Faith" Is A Fine Invention
== POET ==
Emily Dickinson
== POEM ==
"Faith" is a fine invention
When Gentlemen can see—
But Microscopes are prudent
In an Emergency.

== TITLE ==
The Red Wheelbarrow
== POET ==
William Carlos Williams
== POEM ==
so much depends
upon 

a red wheel
barrow 

glazed with rain
water 

beside the white
chickens.

== TITLE ==
Fog
== POET ==
Carl Sandburg
== POEM ==
The fog comes
on little cat feet.

It sits looking
over harbor and city
on silent haunches
and then moves on.

== TITLE ==
And The Days Are Not Full Enough
== POET ==
Ezra Pound
== POEM ==
And the days are not full enough
And the nights are not full enough
And life slips by like a field mouse
      Not shaking the grass

== TITLE ==
A Man Said To The Universe:
== POET ==
Stephen Crane
== POEM ==
A man said to the universe: 
"Sir I exist!" 
"However," replied the universe, 
"The fact has not created in me 
A sense of obligation."

== TITLE ==
Alone
== POET ==
Ambrose Bierce
== POEM ==
In contact, lo! the flint and steel,
By sharp and flame, the thought reveal
That he the metal, she the stone,
Had cherished secretly alone.

== TITLE ==
Answer
== POET ==
Sir Walter Scott
== POEM ==
Sound, sound the clarion, fill the fife!
To all the sensual world proclaim,
One crowded hour of glorious life
Is worth an age without a name.

== TITLE ==
There Was An Old Man In A Tree
== POET ==
Edward Lear
== POEM ==
There was an Old Man in a tree,
Who was horribly bored by a bee.
When they said "Does it buzz?"
He replied "Yes, it does!
It's a regular brute of a bee!"

== TITLE ==
Dreams
== POET ==
Langston Hughes
== POEM ==
Hold fast to dreams
For if dreams die
Life is a broken-winged bird
That cannot fly.

Hold fast to dreams
For when dreams go
Life is a barren field
Frozen with snow.

== TITLE ==
Time Is
== POET ==
Henry Van Dyke
== POEM ==
Time is 
Too Slow for those who Wait,
Too Swift for those who Fear,
Too Long for those who Grieve,
Too Short for those who Rejoice;
But for those who Love,
Time is not.

== TITLE ==
Love, What Is Love
== POET ==
Robert Louis Stevenson
== POEM ==
Love - what is love? A great and aching heart;
Wrung hands; and silence; and a long despair.
Life - what is life? Upon a moorland bare
To see love coming and see love depart.

== TITLE ==
A Drinking Song
== POET ==
William Butler Yeats
== POEM ==
Wine comes in at the mouth
And love comes in at the eye;
That's all we shall know for truth
Before we grow old and die.
I lift the glass to my mouth,
I look at you, and I sigh.

== TITLE ==
The Cherry Trees
== POET ==
Edward Thomas
== POEM ==
The cherry trees bend over and are shedding,
On the old road where all that passed are dead,
Their petals, strewing the grass as for a wedding
This early May morn when there is none to wed.

== TITLE ==
The Early Morning
== POET ==
Hilaire Belloc
== POEM ==
The moon on the one hand, the dawn on the other:
The moon is my sister, the dawn is my brother.
The moon on my left and the dawn on my right.
My brother, good morning: my sister, good night.

== TITLE ==
Here Dead We Lie
== POET ==
Alfred Edward Housman
== POEM ==
Here dead we lie 
Because we did not choose 
To live and shame the land 
From which we sprung. 

Life, to be sure, 
Is nothing much to lose, 
But young men think it is, 
And we were young.

== TITLE ==
A Very Short Song
== POET ==
Dorothy Parker
== POEM ==
Once, when I was young and true,
Someone left me sad-
Broke my brittle heart in two;
And that is very bad.

Love is for unlucky folk,
Love is but a curse.
Once there was a heart I broke;
And that, I think, is worse.

== TITLE ==
The Crocodile
== POET ==
Lewis Carroll
== POEM ==
How doth the little crocodile
Improve his shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
On every golden scale! 

How cheerfully he seems to grin
How neatly spreads his claws,
And welcomes little fishes in,
With gently smiling jaws!

== TITLE ==
A Clear Midnight
== POET ==
Walt Whitman
== POEM ==
THIS is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless,
Away from books, away from art, the day erased, the lesson done,
Thee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing, pondering the themes thou
lovest best.
Night, sleep, death and the stars.

 LEVEL THREE

== TITLE ==
Heaven-Haven
== POET ==
Gerard Manley Hopkins
== POEM ==
I have desired to go
Where springs not fail,
To fields where flies no sharp and sided hail,
And a few lilies blow.

And I have asked to be
Where no storms come,
Where the green swell is in the havens dumb,
And out of the swing of the sea.

== TITLE ==
Fire And Ice
== POET ==
Robert Frost
== POEM ==
Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.

== TITLE ==
Jenny Kissed Me
== POET ==
James Henry Leigh Hunt
== POEM ==
Jenny kissed me when we met,
Jumping from the chair she sat in;
Time, you thief, who love to get
Sweets into your list, put that in!
Say I'm weary, say I'm sad,
Say that health and wealth have missed me,
Say I'm growing old, but add,
Jenny kissed me.

== TITLE ==
A Brown Girl Dead
== POET ==
Countee Cullen
== POEM ==
With two white roses on her breasts, 
White candles at head and feet, 
Dark Madonna of the grave she rests; 
Lord Death has found her sweet.

Her mother pawned her wedding ring
To lay her out in white; 
She'd be so proud she'd dance and sing
to see herself tonight.

== TITLE ==
A White Rose
== POET ==
John Boyle O'Reilly
== POEM ==
The red rose whispers of passion,
And the white rose breathes of love;
O, the red rose is a falcon,
And the white rose is a dove.

But I send you a cream-white rosebud
With a flush on its petal tips;
For the love that is purest and sweetest
Has a kiss of desire on the lips

== TITLE ==
A Girl
== POET ==
Ezra Pound
== POEM ==
The tree has entered my hands,
The sap has ascended my arms,
The tree has grown in my breast -
Downward,
The branches grow out of me, like arms.

Tree you are,
Moss you are,
You are violets with wind above them.
A child - so high - you are,
And all this is folly to the world.

== TITLE ==
The Conclusion
== POET ==
Sir Walter Raleigh
== POEM ==
Even such is Time, that takes in trust 
Our youth, our joys, our all we have, 
And pays us but with earth and dust; 
   Who in the dark and silent grave, 
When we have wander'd all our ways, 
Shuts up the story of our days; 
But from this earth, this grave, this dust, 
My God shall raise me up, I trust.

== TITLE ==
All Day I Hear The Noise Of Waters
== POET ==
James Joyce
== POEM ==
All day I hear the noise of waters 
Making moan, 
Sad as the sea-bird is when, going 
Forth alone, 
He hears the winds cry to the water's 
Monotone. 

The grey winds, the cold winds are blowing 
Where I go. 
I hear the noise of many waters 
Far below. 
All day, all night, I hear them flowing 
To and fro.

== TITLE ==
He Wishes For The Cloths Of Heaven
== POET ==
William Butler Yeats
== POEM ==
Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half-light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.

== TITLE ==
A Farewell
== POET ==
Charles Kingsley
== POEM ==
I

My fairest child, I have no song to give you; 
No lark could pipe to skies so dull and grey: 
Yet, ere we part, one lesson I can leave you 
For every day. 

II 

Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever; 
Do noble things, not dream them, all day long: 
And so make life, death, and that vast for-ever 
One grand, sweet song.

== TITLE ==
A Golden Day
== POET ==
Paul Laurence Dunbar
== POEM ==
I Found you and I lost you, 
All on a gleaming day. 
The day was filled with sunshine, 
And the land was full of May.

A golden bird was singing 
Its melody divine, 
I found you and I loved you, 
And all the world was mine.

I found you and I lost you, 
All on a golden day, 
But when I dream of you, dear, 
It is always brimming May.

== TITLE ==
On Being Brought From Africa To America
== POET ==
Phillis Wheatley
== POEM ==
'Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,
Taught my benighted soul to understand
That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too:
Once I redemption neither sought nor knew.
Some view our sable race with scornful eye,
"Their colour is a diabolic die."
Remember, Christians, Negro's, black as Cain,
May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.

== TITLE ==
Advice To A Girl
== POET ==
Sara Teasdale
== POEM ==
No one worth possessing
Can be quite possessed;
Lay that on your heart,
My young angry dear;
This truth, this hard and precious stone,
Lay it on your hot cheek,
Let it hide your tear.
Hold it like a crystal
When you are alone
And gaze in the depths of the icy stone.
Long, look long and you will be blessed:
No one worth possessing
Can be quite possessed.

== TITLE ==
Hope Is The Thing With Feathers
== POET ==
Emily Dickinson
== POEM ==
'Hope' is the thing with feathers—
That perches in the soul—
And sings the tune without the words—
And never stops—at all—

And sweetest—in the Gale—is heard—
And sore must be the storm—
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm—

I've heard it in the chillest land—
And on the strangest Sea—
Yet, never, in Extremity,
It asked a crumb—of Me.

== TITLE ==
Disillusionment Of Ten O'Clock
== POET ==
Wallace Stevens
== POEM ==
The houses are haunted
By white night-gowns.
None are green,
Or purple with green rings,
Or green with yellow rings,
Or yellow with blue rings.
None of them are strange,
With socks of lace
And beaded ceintures.
People are not going
To dream of baboons and periwinkles.
Only, here and there, an old sailor,
Drunk and asleep in his boots,
Catches Tigers
In red weather.

== TITLE ==
The Swing
== POET ==
Robert Louis Stevenson
== POEM ==
How do you like to go up in a swing, 
Up in the air so blue? 
Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing 
Ever a child can do! 

Up in the air and over the wall, 
Till I can see so wide, 
River and trees and cattle and all 
Over the countryside-- 

Till I look down on the garden green, 
Down on the roof so brown-- 
Up in the air I go flying again, 
Up in the air and down!

== TITLE ==
Autumn Song
== POET ==
Sarojini Naidu
== POEM ==
Like a joy on the heart of a sorrow,
   The sunset hangs on a cloud;
A golden storm of glittering sheaves,
Of fair and frail and fluttering leaves,
   The wild wind blows in a cloud.

Hark to a voice that is calling
   To my heart in the voice of the wind:
My heart is weary and sad and alone,
For its dreams like the fluttering leaves have gone,
   And why should I stay behind?

== TITLE ==
All Nature Has A Feeling
== POET ==
John Clare
== POEM ==
All nature has a feeling: woods, fields, brooks
Are life eternal: and in silence they
Speak happiness beyond the reach of books;
There's nothing mortal in them; their decay
Is the green life of change; to pass away
And come again in blooms revivified.
Its birth was heaven, eternal it its stay,
And with the sun and moon shall still abide
Beneath their day and night and heaven wide.

== TITLE ==
There Is Pleasure In The Pathless Woods
== POET ==
George Gordon Byron
== POEM ==
There is a pleasure in the pathless woods, 
There is a rapture on the lonely shore, 
There is society, where none intrudes, 
By the deep sea, and music in its roar: 
I love not man the less, but Nature more, 
From these our interviews, in which I steal 
From all I may be, or have been before, 
To mingle with the Universe, and feel 
What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.

== TITLE ==
No Man Is An Island
== POET ==
John Donne
== POEM ==
No man is an island,
Entire of itself,
Every man is a piece of the continent,
A part of the main.
If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less.
As well as if a promontory were.
As well as if a manor of thy friend's
Or of thine own were:
Any man's death diminishes me,
Because I am involved in mankind,
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; 
It tolls for thee.

== TITLE ==
Some One
== POET ==
Walter de la Mare
== POEM ==
Some one came knocking
At my wee, small door;
Someone came knocking;
I'm sure-sure-sure;
I listened, I opened,
I looked to left and right,
But nought there was a stirring
In the still dark night;
Only the busy beetle
Tap-tapping in the wall,
Only from the forest
The screech-owl's call,
Only the cricket whistling
While the dewdrops fall,
So I know not who came knocking,
At all, at all, at all.

== TITLE ==
Alone
== POET ==
Sara Teasdale
== POEM ==
I am alone, in spite of love,
In spite of all I take and give—
In spite of all your tenderness,
Sometimes I am not glad to live.

I am alone, as though I stood
On the highest peak of the tired gray world,
About me only swirling snow,
Above me, endless space unfurled;

With earth hidden and heaven hidden,
And only my own spirit's pride
To keep me from the peace of those
Who are not lonely, having died.

== TITLE ==
Hero And Leander
== POET ==
Christopher Marlowe
== POEM ==
It lies not in our power to love or hate,
For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.
hen two are stript long ere the course begin,
We wish that one should lose, the other win;
And one especially do we affect
Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:
The reason no man knows; let it suffice,
What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.
Where both deliberate, the love is slight:
Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight.

== TITLE ==
Indeed, Indeed I Cannot Tell
== POET ==
Henry David Thoreau
== POEM ==
Indeed indeed, I cannot tell, 
Though I ponder on it well, 
Which were easier to state, 
All my love or all my hate. 
Surely, surely, thou wilt trust me 
When I say thou dost disgust me. 
O, I hate thee with a hate 
That would fain annihilate; 
Yet sometimes against my will, 
My dear friend, I love thee still. 
It were treason to our love, 
And a sin to God above, 
One iota to abate 
Of a pure impartial hate.

== TITLE ==
Trees
== POET ==
Joyce Kilmer
== POEM ==
I think that I shall never see	 
A poem lovely as a tree.	 

A tree whose hungry mouth is prest	 
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast; 

A tree that looks at God all day,	
And lifts her leafy arms to pray; 

A tree that may in summer wear	 
A nest of robins in her hair; 

Upon whose bosom snow has lain; 
Who intimately lives with rain.	 

Poems are made by fools like me,	 
But only God can make a tree.

== TITLE ==
Who Ever Loved That Loved Not At First Sight?
== POET ==
Christopher Marlowe
== POEM ==
It lies not in our power to love or hate,
For will in us is overruled by fate.
When two are stripped, long ere the course begin,
We wish that one should love, the other win;

And one especially do we affect
Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:
The reason no man knows; let it suffice
What we behold is censured by our eyes.
Where both deliberate, the love is slight:
Who ever loved, that loved not at first sight?

== TITLE ==
Good-Night
== POET ==
Percy Bysshe Shelley
== POEM ==
Good-night? ah! no; the hour is ill
Which severs those it should unite;
Let us remain together still,
Then it will be good night.

How can I call the lone night good,
Though thy sweet wishes wing its flight?
Be it not said, thought, understood --
Then it will be -- good night.

To hearts which near each other move
From evening close to morning light,
The night is good; because, my love,
They never say good-night.

== TITLE ==
Suicide In The Trenches
== POET ==
Siegfried Sassoon
== POEM ==
I knew a simple soldier boy
Who grinned at life in empty joy,
Slept soundly through the lonesome dark,
And whistled early with the lark.

In winter trenches, cowed and glum,
With crumps and lice and lack of rum,
He put a bullet through his brain.
No one spoke of him again.

You smug-faced crowds with kindling eye
Who cheer when soldier lads march by,
Sneak home and pray you'll never know
The hell where youth and laughter go.

== TITLE ==
The Arrow And The Song
== POET ==
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
== POEM ==
I shot an arrow into the air,
It fell to earth, I knew not where; 
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight
Could not follow it in its flight.

I breathed a song into the air,
It fell to earth, I knew not where; 
For who has sight so keen and strong,
That it can follow the flight of song? 

Long, long afterward, in an oak
I found the arrow, still unbroke; 
And the song, from beginning to end,
I found again in the heart of a friend.

== TITLE ==
A Fairy Song
== POET ==
William Shakespeare
== POEM ==
Over hill, over dale,
Thorough bush, thorough brier,
Over park, over pale,
Thorough flood, thorough fire!
I do wander everywhere,
Swifter than the moon's sphere;
And I serve the Fairy Queen,
To dew her orbs upon the green;
The cowslips tall her pensioners be;
In their gold coats spots you see;
Those be rubies, fairy favours;
In those freckles live their savours;
I must go seek some dewdrops here,
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
