Essence

	~ A Role of Life ~


Explanation

	Mantles are the roles of Life (Lfe).
	They are a visualised as a passage in the plane from a Loam to its Roots.

	Every Loam is paired with a Mantle.
	For example, paired with the Loam  'Connection (Lve)'  is the Mantle  'Connector'.

	Additionally, every Mantle is paired with an Act.
	It is a verb given in its -ing form.
	For example, paired with the Mantle  'Connector'  is the Act  'connecting'.

	Continuously doing that Act makes one a 'Wearer' of the Mantle.

	In the First Garden, here are the Five Root Loams paired with the Five Root Mantles:

		Sustenance (Hth)  ::  Sustainer (sustaining)
		Development (Tth)  ::  Developer (developing)
		Connection (Lve)  ::  Connector (connecting)
		Enrichment (Bty)  ::  Enricher (enriching)
		Guidance (Pce)  ::  Guider (guiding)

	A Wearer 'furthers' their Loam and is 'directed' by their Root.
	Hence, a Connector furthers Connection (Lve) and is directed by Love.

	The largest Loam is  Life (Lfe).

	It seems to be paired with the Root of Goodness, but this is not the full story.

	The Mantle paired with Life (Lfe) is a mystery for now.
