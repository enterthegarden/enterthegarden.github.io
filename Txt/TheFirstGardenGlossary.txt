(( ...

In Writings of the Garden, many words begin with a capital letter.
These are (almost always) the Terms of the Garden.

Sometimes there are good reasons to not begin them with a capital letter; for example, for the sake of Beauty.
Sometimes there are good reasons to begin words that are not Terms with a capital letter; for example, 'You'.
It is not too strict.

Here, an Essence and an Explanation is provided for a selection of them.
Not all Terms are included here and not all will be.
Interpretation is invited.

(( Loam ...

Essence

	~ An Area of Life ~


Explanation

	Loams are the areas of  Life (Lfe).
	Life (Lfe), the largest Loam, is envisioned as a circle in the plane.

	All Loams of  Life (Lfe)  have a place in the circle and a three-letter Code.
	The Code is cited afterwards in between brackets.

	In the First Garden, the Five Root Loams are very general:
		
		Sustenance (Hth)
		Development (Tth)
		Connection (Lve)
		Enrichment (Bty)
		Guidance (Pce)

	Some Loams of later Gardens are mentioned in the Writings of the First Garden, such as Science (Sci).

	In the later Gardens, the Loams are more specific and range widely from:
		
		Breathing (Bre)  to  Physics (Phy)  to  Law (Law)

(( Root ...

Essence

	~ A Value of Life ~


Explanation

	Roots are the values of  Life (Lfe).
	They are visualised as special points in the plane.

	Every Loam is paired with a Root.
	For example, paired with the Loam  'Connection (Lve)'  is the Root  'Love'.

	Additionally, every Root is paired with a Quality.
	For example, paired with the Root  'Love'  is the Quality  '(loving)'.

	In the First Garden, here are the Five Roots paired with the Five Root Qualities and the Five Root Loams:

		Health  (healthy)  ::  Sustenance (Hth)
		Truth  (truthful)  ::  Development (Tth)
		Love  (loving)  ::  Connection (Lve)
		Beauty  (beautiful)  ::  Enrichment (Bty)
		Peace  (peaceful)  ::  Guidance (Pce)

	Some other Roots are implied in the Writings of the First Garden, such as 'Freedom' or 'Cleanliness'.

	This is given greater clarity in the later Gardens.

(( Mantle ...

Essence

	~ A Role of Life ~


Explanation

	Mantles are the roles of Life (Lfe).
	They are visualised as a passage in the plane from a Loam to its Roots.

	Every Loam is paired with a Mantle.
	For example, paired with the Loam  'Connection (Lve)'  is the Mantle  'Connector'.

	Additionally, every Mantle is paired with an Act.
	It is a verb given in its -ing form.
	For example, paired with the Mantle  'Connector'  is the Act  'connecting'.

	Continuously doing that Act makes one a 'Wearer' of the Mantle.

	In the First Garden, here are the Five Root Loams paired with the Five Root Mantles:

		Sustenance (Hth)  ::  Sustainer (sustaining)
		Development (Tth)  ::  Developer (developing)
		Connection (Lve)  ::  Connector (connecting)
		Enrichment (Bty)  ::  Enricher (enriching)
		Guidance (Pce)  ::  Guider (guiding)

	A Wearer 'furthers' their Loam and is 'directed' by their Root.
	Hence, a Connector furthers Connection (Lve) and is directed by Love.

	The largest Loam is  Life (Lfe).

	It seems to be paired with the Root of Goodness, but this is not the full story.

	The Mantle paired with Life (Lfe) is a mystery for now.
