Enter the Light.
Come to the Meaning of Being.

These are the Uts of the Being of Heaven.
Existence, the Light, Difference.
These are Uts of the Meaning of Heaven.
Order, the Light, Chaos.

Order is Order.
It is. It is.

Difference is what is not.
If it is different, it is not.

The Light is Beyond.
The Heart of Heaven.
The Focus of Love.
The Meaning of Being.
The Light is Beyond.

Existence is what is.
If it is existent, it is so.

Chaos is Chaos.
It is not. It is.

Witness the Order of Existence by the Light.
And centre upon the Light.
Chaos, Existence, the Light, Difference, Order
These are the Five Uts of Heaven.

Come to the Meaning of Being.
Enter the Light.
