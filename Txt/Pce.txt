How to guide the Peace of People's Spirits?

Raise your Respect.
Refine your Justice.
Increase your Hope.


Raise your Respect.
So, sense your own feelings.
And empathise with those of others.
Compose your own feelings.
And calm those of others.
Be humble before those rightly ahead.
And helpful to those rightly behind.

Refine your Justice.
So, Refine your principles.
And be civil together.
Keep your honour.
And be accountable together.
Be fair to those most wrong.
But, forgiving to those least wrong.

Increase your Hope.
So, Be grateful for your life.
Follow your path in life;
as others will follow theirs.
Have wisdom.
Have balance.
Have hope.


... Peace ))
