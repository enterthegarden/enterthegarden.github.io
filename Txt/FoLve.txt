Outline

Love regards the Bonds of People.
Foremost Love regards the Bonds to those Dear.
Family, friends, children, and more.


To connect at all, learn the languages of your own Heart.
Learn every single word; their stories and their powers.

	Peter Mark Roget (1852), Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases.

To connect to others, learn the languages of their Hearts.
	Learn languages of need, languages of those near, and languages of those Dear.
	Learn some of those least spoken, some of those most spoken (2022):
		Mandarin  |  Hindi  |  Spanish  |  Arabic  |  Russian
	And some to surprise yourself.

	Now as you connect together:
Love one another as you have learned to love yourself.
	Then together make a space.

To make virtual spaces, 
	Promote principles of FOSS and E2EE software in the Fediverse:
	These may come and go, so always have alternatives and spread things out (2022):
		Protonmail  |  Friendica  |  Signal  |  Pixelfed  |  Mastodon
	And make some of your own, too.

To make physical spaces,
	Balance the space with nature, with tradition, and with technology.
	Make places of solitude, places for neighbours, and common places for strangers.
	Keep it accessible, but keep it fortified. 


Our many Hearts connected together, we make one Space.
With common guidance over Time, we make one Spirit.
