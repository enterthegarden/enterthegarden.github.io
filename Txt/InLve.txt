To love yourself and restore Love of your own Heart:


Care for yourself.
Begin with your body.
Begin with your time to breathe.
What you eat makes you, so eat the goods of Earth.
How you move shapes you, so move with Purpose.

Know yourself.
Know what you can change.
Know what you cannot and what you need not.

Be your own friend.
Speak well to yourself. Use kind words.
Make chances to trust yourself.
Start small and grow from there.
Believe in yourself.
And when itâ€™s time for others, set your boundaries.

Accept yourself.
Accept your appearance and your past.
Move forward by comparing yourself only to who you were.

Control yourself.
Have standards and live up to them.
You can make mistakes, so learn to forgive yourself.
If you have today, you have a chance, you have hope.

You are worth Goodness.
Despite any wrongs you have done.
Despite any wrongs that have been done to you.
You are always worthy of Goodness.


... Inmost Love ))
