How to connect the Love in People's Hearts?

Be kind.
Kind to children.
Kind to animals.
Kind to strangers.
Visit the sick.
Give to the poor.
Protect the weak.

Gather together.
Together with trust.
Together with warmth.

Listen to each other.
Tell the truth.
Tell it with beauty.
Share a smile.
Share some food.
Share a hug.
Respect differences.
Forgive wrongdoings.
And always bring hope.

Feel confident.
Learn another language.
Tell a good joke.
Try something new!
Try it together.


... Love ))
