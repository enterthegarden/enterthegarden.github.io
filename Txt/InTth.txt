Outline

 Truth regards Minds reflecting Worlds.
 Inmost Truth regards the reflecting itself.
 This is the Loam of Thought (Tht).

 Here, the ‘reflecting’ means understanding.
 The universal thing to understand are the forms.
 Therefore, develop understanding of the forms themselves.

 For this, the nearest selected Loam is Mathematics (Mth).
