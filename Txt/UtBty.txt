Outline

 Beauty regards the World reflecting the Soul.
 Utmost Beauty regards the World able to reflect every Soul.
 This is the Loam of Worldbuilding (WdB).

 With few resources, a relevant Loam is Literature (Lit).
 With modern resources, a relevant art is artificial reality.

 Artificial reality has seen rapid advances recently.
 If current progress rates continue, dependence on extended realities is possible.
 Therefore, this art must be engaged with wisely.
