Dear One,

Our home here has many beautiful gardens.
They are places of life and caring.
From this comes the idea of the Garden.

The Garden is wherever People are.
So, it is wherever you are.

The Garden grows whenever People do Good.
So, it grows whenever you do Good.

Focus!

Have the Best Character.
As this will be your Greatest Success.

Live with the Best Patience.
As this will be your Greatest Power.

Now act with Courage.
Follow the Path of Deepest Love.
Find for yourself the Meaning of Being.

Enter the Garden.

Health | Truth | Love | Beauty | Peace

How you move shapes you, so move with Purpose.

Know yourself.
Know what you can change.
Know what you cannot and what you need not.

Be your own friend.
Speak well to yourself. Use kind words.
Make chances to trust yourself.
Start small and grow from there.
Believe in yourself.
And when it’s time for others, set your boundaries.

Accept yourself.
Accept your appearance and your past.
Move forward by comparing yourself only to who you were.

Control yourself.
Have standards and live up to them.
You can make mistakes, so learn to forgive yourself.
If you have today, you have a chance, you have hope.

You are worth Goodness.
Despite any wrongs you have done.
Despite any wrongs that have been done to you.
You are always worthy of Goodness.

Book:
* Peter Mark Roget (1852), Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases.

To connect to others, learn the languages of their Hearts.
Learn languages of need, languages of those near, and languages of those Dear.
Learn some of those least spoken, some of those most spoken (2022):
* Mandarin
* Hindi
* Spanish
* Arabic
* Russian
And some to surprise yourself.

Now as you connect together:
Love one another as you have learned to love yourself.
Then together make a space.

To make virtual spaces,
Promote principles of FOSS and E2EE software in the Fediverse:
These may come and go, so always have alternatives and spread things out (2022):
* Protonmail
* Friendica
* Signal
* Pixelfed
* Mastodon
And make some of your own, too.

To make physical spaces,
Balance the space with nature, with tradition, and with technology.
Make places of solitude, places for neighbours, and common places for strangers.
Keep it accessible, but keep it fortified. 


Our many Hearts connected together, we make one Space.
With common guidance over Time, we make one Spirit.

Love regards the Bonds of People.
Utmost Love regards the Creation of People.
This is Lifebuilding (LfB).


For People, this so often begins with Relations (New).

For any relations at all, be ready.
Ready in your Body, in your Mind, and in your Soul.
These differ and have differed as much as People differ and have differed.
But, what is the same is the need for Inmost Love.

Then for relations with each other, be ready in your Hearts.
Love one another as you have learned to love yourself.
Relations can bring a new life, so be ready for a new life.
Whatever has happened to you, whatever will happen to you, 
You are always worthy of Goodness.

And eventually, this so often couples with Nurturing (Nur).

Care for who you nurture.
Stay together and be each other’s family.

Provide them their needs; their food, their clothing, and their shelter.
But, encourage their strength to provide for themselves.

Teach them the universe; read together and play together.
But, encourage their curiosity so that they may teach themselves.

Love them dearly; hug them, listen to them, and give them a home.
But, let them learn to love themselves.
So they can rightly love their family and the wider world.

Cherish them, however they appear; and have no favourites.
But, encourage their self expression so that they may cherish themselves.

Guide them by the example of your character.
Be fair; but, be forgiving.
It will be difficult. Have patience.
Stay together.

(( Who? ...

Dear One,
Who are you?

First is your Body.
 It senses, moves, and breathes.
 And it is your extent over space.
 Its needs give you the instincts to live.

Next is your Mind.
 It thinks.
 It understands.

Centre of all is your Heart.
 It is your extent over People.
 And its desires give you
 the reasons to live.

Next is your Soul.
 It dreams.
 It experiences.

Last is your Spirit.
 It is past, present, and future.
 And it is your extent over time.
 Its rules give you the ways to live.


... Who? ))
