Dear One,

Enter the Garden.
Come to the Path of Deepest Love.

You can be the Green of the Gardens.
You can further the Greatest of Goodness.

We are the People of this World.

Focus

This is the Purpose of our Life.

We might witness Everything as One.
We might witness the Light of Heaven.

Come to the Meaning of Being.
Enter the Light.
