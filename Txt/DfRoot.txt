Essence

	~ A Value of Life ~


Explanation

	Roots are the values of  Life (Lfe).
	They are visualised as special points in the plane.

	Every Loam is paired with a Root.
	For example, paired with the Loam  'Connection (Lve)'  is the Root  'Love'.

	Additionally, every Root is paired with a Quality.
	For example, paired with the Root  'Love'  is the Quality  '(loving)'.

	In the First Garden, here are the Five Roots paired with the Five Root Qualities and the Five Root Loams:

		Health  (healthy)  ::  Sustenance (Hth)
		Truth  (truthful)  ::  Development (Tth)
		Love  (loving)  ::  Connection (Lve)
		Beauty  (beautiful)  ::  Enrichment (Bty)
		Peace  (peaceful)  ::  Guidance (Pce)

	Some other Roots are implied in the Writings of the First Garden, such as 'Freedom' or 'Cleanliness'.

	This is given greater clarity in the later Gardens.
