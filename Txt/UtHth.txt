There is an escalating probability of global disaster.
There are natural precedents for this;
such as the Carrington Event and the COVID-19 pandemic.
And there are artificial possibilities for this;
such as nuclear holocaust and uncontrolled artificial intelligence.
Therefore, preparations must be made.

Support better emergency management.
And, most importantly, support better Guidance for us all.
