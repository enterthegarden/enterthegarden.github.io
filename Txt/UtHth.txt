Outline

 Health regards the Needs of People.
 Utmost Health regards the Needs of Everyone.

 There is an escalating probability of global disaster.
 There are natural precedents for this;
 such as the Carrington Event and the COVID-19 pandemic.
 And there are artificial possibilities for this;
 such as nuclear holocaust and uncontrolled artificial intelligence.
 Therefore, preparations must be made.

 Support projects increasing the modularity of society;
 such as eGranary and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.
 Support better emergency management.
 And, most importantly, support better Guidance (Pce) for us all.
