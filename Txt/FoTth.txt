Outline

 Truth regards the Mind reflecting the World.
 Foremost Truth regards this World, as it seems, reflected into the Minds of People.

 Here, the ‘reflecting’ means understanding.
 Its Aspects are Science (Sci) and Technology (Tch).
 Therefore, understand these Aspects, as they seem, Now.

 This is far beyond the scope of a single page.
 However, the selected Loams are:
  Physics (Phy), Chemistry (Chm), Biology (Bio)
