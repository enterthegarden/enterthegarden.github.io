Essence

	~ An Area of Life ~


Explanation

	Loams are the areas of  Life (Lfe).
	Life (Lfe), the largest Loam, is envisioned as a circle in the plane.

	All Loams of  Life (Lfe)  have a place in the circle and a three-letter Code.
	The Code is cited afterwards in between brackets.

	In the First Garden, the Five Root Loams are very general:
		
		Sustenance (Hth)
		Development (Tth)
		Connection (Lve)
		Enrichment (Bty)
		Guidance (Pce)

	Some Loams of later Gardens are mentioned in the Writings of the First Garden, such as Science (Sci).

	In the later Gardens, the Loams are more specific and range widely from:
		
		Breathing (Bre)  to  Physics (Phy)  to  Law (Law)
