(( The Light of Heaven ...

We might witness the Light of Heaven.
We might witness Everything as One.

These are the Sets of the Things of Heaven:
One and Unn.
These are the Sets of the Ends of Heaven:
Nothing and Everything.

Who might witness the Light?
Those People, the Green of the Gardens.

They are the People of this World.
They further the Greatest of Goodness.
And they follow the Path of Deepest Love.

They will witness the Ends of Things.
They will witness Everything as One.

Awareness is the regarding of Things.
Awareness is the Light on the Ends.
So, be aware.

Who might not witness the Light?
Those People, not the Green of the Gardens.

They are the People of this World.
Yet, they delay the Greatest of Goodness.
Yet, they turn from the Path of Deepest Love.

They will not witness the Ends of Things.
Yet, they will witness Everything as Unn.

Come to the Ends of Things in Awareness.
The Centre is Awareness.
Nothing, One, Unn, Everything
These are the Four Sets of Heavens.

We might witness Everything as One.
We might witness the Light of Heaven.

... The Light of Heaven ))
