You can be the Green of the Gardens.
You can further the Greatest of Goodness.

Choose between these Four Wants of People.
Meagreness, Goodness, Evilness, Greatness.
And centre upon Choice.
And find the Growth of Worth in Choice.

There are those furthering the Greatest of Evilness, who you are not to be.
They are highest in Growth, yet least in Worth.

As their Greatest Success was having the Worst Character.
And their Greatest Freedoms were met with the Worst Courage.
And their Greatest Power was shown the Worst Patience.

They will be the Last in the Garden.
And they will be the Least to the Light.

Choice regards the Wants You have Now.
So choose Goodness before Greatness Now.
So that Greatness may choose You.

There are those furthering the Greatest of Goodness, who you are to be.
They are highest in Growth and most in Worth.

As their Greatest Success was having the Best Character.
And their Greatest Freedoms were met with the Best Courage.
And their Greatest Power was shown the Best Patience.

They will be the First in the Garden.
And they will be the Most to the Light.

Meagreness and Greatness.
These are the Wants of the Growth of Life.
Goodness and Evilness.
These are the Wants of the Worth of Life.

You can further the Greatest of Goodness.

Yet, they delay the Greatest of Goodness.
Yet, they turn from the Path of Deepest Love.

They will not witness the Ends of Things.
Yet, they will witness Everything as Unn.

Love regards the Bonds of People.
Utmost Love regards the Creation of People.
This is the Loam of Lifebuilding (LfB).

For People, this so often begins with Intimacy (New).

	For any intimacy at all, be ready.
	Ready in your Body, in your Mind, and in your Soul.
	These differ and have differed as much as People differ and have differed.
	But, what is the same is the need for Inmost Love.

	Then for intimacy with each other, be ready in your Hearts.
	Love one another as you have learned to love yourself.
	Intimacy can bring a new life, so be ready for a new life.
	Whatever has happened to you, whatever will happen to you, 
	You are always worthy of Goodness.

And eventually, this so often couples with Nurturing (Nur).

	Care for who you nurture.
	Stay together and be each other’s family.

	Provide them their needs; their food, their clothing, and their shelter.
	But, encourage their strength to provide for themselves.

	Teach them the universe; read together and play together.
	But, encourage their curiosity so that they may teach themselves.

	Love them dearly; hug them, listen to them, and give them a home.
	But, let them learn to love themselves.
	So they can rightly love their family and the wider world.

	Cherish them, however they appear; and have no favourites.
	But, encourage their self expression so that they may cherish themselves.

	Guide them by the example of your character.
	Be fair; but, be forgiving.
	It will be difficult. Have patience.

Outline

 Beauty regards the World reflecting the Soul.
 Utmost Beauty regards the World able to reflect every Soul.
 This is the Loam of Worldbuilding (WdB).

 With few resources, a relevant Loam is Literature (Lit).
 With modern resources, a relevant art is artificial reality.

 Artificial reality has seen rapid advances recently.
 If current progress rates continue, dependence on extended realities is possible.
 Therefore, this art must be engaged with wisely.
