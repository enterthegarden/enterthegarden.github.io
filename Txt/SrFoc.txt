(( The People of this World ...

We are the People of this World.
This is the Purpose of our Life.

There are Four Parts of this World
Ana, Matter, Unmatter, Kata.
And they will be centred by Will.
And they will be witnessed by Will.

Ana regards Past, Down, and others alike.
Ana forms the Substrate of this World.

Matter is within the Substrate, yet unlike Unmatter.
Matter forms the Substance of this World.

Ana to Kata.
Matter to Unmatter.

We are Here.
Focus.
We are Now.

Unmatter to Matter.
Kata to Ana.

Unmatter forms the Substance of this World.
Unmatter is within the Substrate, yet unlike Matter.

Kata forms the Substrate of this World.
Kata regards Future, Up, and others alike.

And what was witnessed by Will.
And what was centred by Will:
Kata, Unmatter, Matter, Ana.
These are the Four Parts of this World.

This is the Purpose of our Life.
We are the People of this World.
