(( The Green of the Gardens ...

You can be the Green of the Gardens.
You can further the Greatest of Goodness.

Choose between these Four Wants of People.
Meagreness, Goodness, Evilness, Greatness.
And centre upon Choice.
And find the Growth of Worth in Choice.

There are those furthering the Greatest of Evilness, who you are not to be.
They are highest in Growth, yet least in Worth.

As their Greatest Success was having the Worst Character.
And their Greatest Freedoms were met with the Worst Courage.
And their Greatest Power was shown the Worst Patience.

They will be the Last in the Garden.
And they will be the Least to the Light.

Choice regards the Wants You have Now.
So choose Goodness before Greatness Now.
So that Greatness may choose You.

There are those furthering the Greatest of Goodness, who you are to be.
They are highest in Growth and most in Worth.

As their Greatest Success was having the Best Character.
And their Greatest Freedoms were met with the Best Courage.
And their Greatest Power was shown the Best Patience.

They will be the First in the Garden.
And they will be the Most to the Light.

Meagreness and Greatness.
These are the Wants of the Growth of Life.
Goodness and Evilness.
These are the Wants of the Worth of Life.

You can further the Greatest of Goodness.
You can be the Green of the Gardens.
