(( Who? ...

Dear One,
Who are you?

First is your Body.
 It senses, moves, and breathes.
 And it is your extent over space.
 Its needs give you the instincts to live.

Next is your Mind.
 It thinks.
 It understands.

Centre of all is your Heart.
 It is your extent over People.
 And its desires give you
 the reasons to live.

Next is your Soul.
 It dreams.
 It experiences.

Last is your Spirit.
 It is past, present, and future.
 And it is your extent over time.
 Its rules give you the ways to live.
