(( Utmost Love ...

Why?
Utmost Love is for Love.
Love is for Goodness.

What?
Utmost Connection is part of Connection.
Connection is part of Improving.

Who?
Utmost Connectors are Connectors.
Connectors are Improvers.


Love regards the Bonds of People.
Utmost Love regards the Creation of People.
This is Lifebuilding (LfB).


For People, this so often begins with Relations (New).

For any relations at all, be ready.
Ready in your Body, in your Mind, and in your Soul.
These differ and have differed as much as People differ and have differed.
But, what is the same is the need for Inmost Love.

Then for relations with each other, be ready in your Hearts.
Love one another as you have learned to love yourself.
Relations can bring a new life, so be ready for a new life.
Whatever has happened to you, whatever will happen to you, 
You are always worthy of Goodness.

And eventually, this so often couples with Nurturing (Nur).

Care for who you nurture.
Stay together and be each otherâ€™s family.

Provide them their needs; their food, their clothing, and their shelter.
But, encourage their strength to provide for themselves.

Teach them the universe; read together and play together.
But, encourage their curiosity so that they may teach themselves.

Love them dearly; hug them, listen to them, and give them a home.
But, let them learn to love themselves.
So they can rightly love their family and the wider world.

Cherish them, however they appear; and have no favourites.
But, encourage their self expression so that they may cherish themselves.

Guide them by the example of your character.
Be fair; but, be forgiving.
It will be difficult. Have patience.
Stay together.


... Utmost Love ))
