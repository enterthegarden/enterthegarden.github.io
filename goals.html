  GOALS


<br><br>

You are an individual.
<br><br>
You could be a 64 year old blueberry farming grandmother from Canada.
<br><br>
You could be a 21 year old law student from China.
<br><br>
You could be facing school exams, religious persecution, jail time, or the loss of a loved one.
<br><br>
I respect your individuality.
<br><br>
The reason you're here and the reason the Garden is here is for self-education.
<br><br>
<br><br>

The Garden is for powering your self-education.
<br><br>
It has always been about this.
<br><br>
Plenty of material will be added in the future.
<br><br>
But, right now, at the beginning of things, it's about Quality and Priority.
<br><br>
I will explain how the Garden provides this.
<br><br>
<br><br>

The three biggest enemies at a "meta-" level for all of us (including the grandmother and the law student) are these:
<br><br>
  <b>Ignorance</b> + <b>Incompetence</b> + <b>Indifference</b>
<br><br>
What's that? Not climate change or cybersecurity?
<br><br>
That's right. Not those. Let me communicate by an analogy:
<br><br>
If you're sitting in a room of your house next to a bucket, and there's a fire in the other room, what happens?
<br><br>
Nothing necessarily. The first step is being aware of the fire. Otherwise, you're *ignorant*.
<br><br>
The next step is having that bucket be full of water and you being able to lift it. Otherwise, you're *incompetent*.
<br><br>
And the last step is caring enough to put out the flames. Otherwise, you're *indifferent*.
<br><br>
You see now what I mean by problems at a "meta-" level?
<br><br>
The way you address these enemies is:
<br><br>
  <b>Knowledge</b>, <i>which overcomes</i> <b>Ignorance</b>
<br><br>
  <b>Power</b>, <i>which overcomes</i> <b>Incompetence</b>
<br><br>
  <b>Will</b>, <i>which overcomes</i> <b>Indifference</b>
<br><br>
(You could argue it's the proper form of Love or Good Character or someone's Heart, which overcomes indifference. I accept all of these.)
<br><br>
<br><br>


Now you understand that, here's the connection to the Garden.
<br><br>
The Garden provides maps of general knowledge and general skills (which are the key to power).
<br><br>
Every single selected fact and skill has had to fight for its life to be included.
<br><br>
Hundreds of hours spent researching, asking experts, and vigorously debating.
<br><br>
This is significant. You get all of the concentrated quality.
<br><br>
By investing in your general knowledge and general skill set, you'll stay balanced and adaptable.
<br><br>
Which is an ideal way to be for handling the specifics of your life.
<br><br>
The one who can endure change.
<br><br>
<br><br>

But, how will you invest exactly?
<br><br>
This is where the <a href="values"><b>Priorities</b></a> and <a href="routines"><b>Routines</b></a> come to the fore.
<br><br>
It's not about making it easy.
<br><br>
It's about arming you for the biggest battle of your life.
<br><br>
Giving you command over your day and the assurance that you know exactly what to do with the time you have.
