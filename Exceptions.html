        Entering the Garden gives you responsibilities for life.
        <br>But, there are Times of Exception.
        <br>Find them wisely and think of others.

        If you become sick, make this a priority.
        <br>If others become sick, visit them and care for them.
        <br>When others are desperate for care, be the stable and reliable one.
        <br>
        <br>If you become destitute, ask for help, and remember those who helped you.
        <br>So, give to the poor when they ask and be remembered for your way.
        <br>
        <br>If you are traveling, make time for your hosts.
        <br>If you are fighting, then focus and win the fight first.





        <br>Remember children.
        <br>And remember that you were once a child.
        <br>
        <br>So, if a small bird lands on you, smile for it.
        <br>If a child invites you to a game, join in and have fun.
        <br>And if you see a gorgeous sunset, delight in it.





        <br>You are part of something bigger.
        <br>And you can do your part to make it better.
        <br>
        <br>Perhaps there are special days in your nation,
        <br>Perhaps there are traditions you know of valuing families and life,
        <br>And perhaps there are religions valuing an eternal message,
        <br>
        <br>Take time off and show up!
        <br>If there is Goodness in it, bring it as far out as you can!
