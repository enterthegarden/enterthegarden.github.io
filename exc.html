        <br>If you become sick, make this a priority.
        <br>If others become sick, visit them and care for them.
        <br>When others are desperate for care, be the stable and reliable one.
        <br>
        <br>If you become destitute, ask for help, and remember those who helped you.
        <br>So, give to the poor when they ask and be remembered for your way.

        <br>If you are traveling, make time for your hosts.
        <br>If you are fighting, then focus and win the fight first.

        <br>And remember that you were once a child.
