(( Way : The Righteous Way ...

Dear One,

Your time is divided into Days.
And a Day is the time between rising and resting.

Your Days are divided into Deeds.
And a Deed can range from wrongful to righteous.

Righteous Deeds bring you earnings.
Centering upon the One is the highest earning Deed.
The ways of centering differ by tradition, location, and person.

But for those without, a beginning way of centering is provided.

	Rise & Declare
	Rise & Commit
	Open the Day
	Center
	Close the Day
	Rise & Measure
	Rest & Declare

Each Day can reward you up to 125 earnings.

Earnings are gathered and measured through 21 Deeds.
The 4 opening, 1 central, and 4 closing Deeds are for centering.
These deeds are seeds to sow and will grow into the Green of the Garden.

Half of the earnings of centering are for cleaning yourself well.
The other half are for what you notice or remember.

The remaining deeds give up to 5 earnings each.
Your responsibility is to measure them well.

Begin the Day.
