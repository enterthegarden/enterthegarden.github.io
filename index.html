    Greetings! The Garden is a carefully curated selection of skills procurable to all those without significant time, health, and information restrictions. The selection strikes a balance by including skills needed by both ancestral humans and modern humans. Some skills have precise objective standards attached to them, while others are much more open ended. Most strikingly, some of them have low barriers to entry, while others take a lifetime to master. The individual who has successfully engaged with all of them can live assured that they are a competent individual. It is intended for self-education, but may be freely adopted and adapted for schools. Get competent!

  <p id="farming">
    <b>Farming</b>: Start composting by collecting organic waste (food scraps, leaves) to create nutrient-rich compost for soil enrichment. Understand your soil by testing soil pH & nutrients; tailor farming practices to soil characteristics. Choose crops suited to local climate/soil; rotate crops annually to prevent nutrient depletion & manage pests/diseases. Follow correct timing, depth, spacing for sowing seeds; harden off seedlings before transplanting. Use water-saving irrigation methods (drip irrigation, soaker hoses) to minimise water use & encourage deep roots. Apply mulch to suppress weeds; use companion plants to attract beneficial insects for pest control. Check crops for stress, pests, disease; harvest at peak for best quality. Regularly clean, sharpen, store tools properly for readiness. Stay updated on farming techniques via workshops, community networking.
  </p>

  <p id="nutrition">
    <b>Nutrition</b>: Calculate calorie & nutrient needs based on age, gender, activity level, & health goals. Test & adjust diet to manage food reactions, like allergies, safely. Learn to interpret nutritional facts & ingredient lists on packages (ingredients are listed by abundance). Use local & seasonal produce to boost nutrition & support sustainability. Ensure a mix of proteins, fats, carbs, & essential micronutrients in each meal. Apply proper hygiene & cooking methods to prevent illnesses (esp. washing hands, keeping raw & cooked foods separate). Store food properly to prevent spoilage & contamination (refrigerate perishables, rotate goods). Reduce waste using efficient leftover use & mindful purchasing. Control portions using tools like measuring cups & scales. Monitor symptoms like fatigue & dizziness; manage accordingly. Fast under guidance with proper hydration & nutrient intake. Keep updated with nutritional guidelines & science for diet improvement.
  </p>

  <p id="firstaid">
    <b>First Aid</b>: Verify the scene safety for yourself & the victim before intervening. Assess the emergency's nature, severity, & involved individuals. Dial emergency services for severe situations; provide precise location & details. Check responsiveness, breathing, major bleeding, or life-threatening conditions. Begin CPR (if needed) with chest compressions & rescue breaths if unresponsive & not breathing. If there’s bleeding, use a clean cloth for direct pressure; elevate the wound if possible. Apply the Heimlich manoeuvre or abdominal thrusts if they’re unable to cough, speak, or breathe. Place unconscious but breathing persons in the recovery position to keep their airway clear. For burns, cool them under running water for 10+ minutes, cover with a sterile, non-adhesive bandage. Wash cuts with water, apply antiseptic, & cover with a sterile bandage. Immobilise fractures with splints/bandages; avoid unnecessary movement. For allergies, use epinephrine auto-injector if necessary for severe reactions. Stay with the person, keeping them comfortable without food or drink until help arrives. Track vital signs & changes; provide details to emergency responders.
  </p>

  <p id="hygiene">
    <b>Hygiene</b>: Wash hands for 20s with soap & water (get all surfaces, e.g. between fingers & under nails). Do often, esp. before meals, post-restroom, and when coming home. Brush teeth twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, and floss daily. Bathe regularly with mild soap, focus on sweaty areas. Use sunscreen when outdoors, and consider moisturising daily. Trim your nails straight. Wear clean clothes (esp. undergarments); wash them regularly with the warmest water safe for the fabric; dry them well. Disinfect high-touch surfaces (doorknobs, switches) & personal items (phone). Sanitise hygiene tools, too. Dispose of waste in a lined bin, empty often to avoid pests & odour. Wash hands pre-prep, and keep the kitchen clean to prevent illness.
  </p>

  <p id="crafting">
    <b>Crafting</b>: Know the materials you have (hardness, malleability, grain, melting point, etc.) to guide the process. Source quality materials based on texture, durability, purity, composition based on type (wood, stone, metal). Get & maintain craft-specific tools (saws, chisels for wood; hammers for metal). Learn foundational techniques (cutting, shaping wood; welding metal), practice for proficiency. Get protective gear; if suited, ventilate the area. Plan your project: design, dimensions, and steps. Sketch & prototype it to refine it. Measure & prep carefully pre-altering for precision & quality. Practice and experiment with techniques & materials. Learn from success & failure. Finish your product (sand, paint, or seal for aesthetics & durability). For quality control: check for imperfections, test its function, and identify improvements. Engage with the community: collaborate, go to workshops, keep learning & evolving.
  </p>

  <p id="belongings">
    <b>Belongings</b>: Assess your needs & declutter regularly. Invest in quality, versatile storage (shelves, bins, baskets). Create & maintain an inventory, (esp. of valuables & essentials). Organise by use frequency: frequent - more accessible, infrequent - less so. Designate spots for daily items. Label & categorise storage for easy access. Clean & do basic repairs regularly to extend life. Protect valuables with locks, safes, archival materials. Prepare an emergency kit with water, food, first aid, flashlight, and batteries. Check & refresh periodically. Review & adapt organisation systems as needs change.
  </p>

  <p id="safety">
    <b>Safety</b>: Be aware of surroundings & dangers to avoid risks & react quickly. Learn to de-escalate conflicts verbally to avoid physical confrontation.

Have accessible fire extinguishers & know the PASS method (Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep). Create & practice fire evacuation routes for home & work. Know the fire exits wherever you are; have a meeting spot, too. Prepare for natural disasters with kits, plans, and evacuation route knowledge. Learn first aid & CPR for emergencies (choking, heart attacks, injuries). Review safety knowledge & practice skills regularly, esp. evacuation or fire extinguisher use.
  </p>

  <p id="fitness">
    <b>Fitness</b>: Set clear, achievable goals: specific, measurable, realistic. Mix cardio, strength, and flexibility training. Balance your training plan: varied exercises (run, swim, cycle, bodyweight, weights) for all muscle groups. Start slow, and gradually increase intensity & duration to avoid injury & sustain improvement. Cross-train to improve overall fitness, prevent boredom & avoid overuse injuries. Rest & recover between workouts, include active recovery to heal & avoid burnout. Have a balanced diet for your goals: hydration, protein, carbs, fats. Be consistent & accountable: schedule your workouts, and involve others for motivation. Focus on proper form for effectiveness & injury prevention. Get guidance if needed. Track progress & celebrate milestones with trackers or journals. Adjust your plan as needed. Regularly update & reassess goals to avoid plateaus & stay motivated.
