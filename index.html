<h3 id="1">Is Intelligence fixed?</h3>
<b>Problem!</b> Psychometricians unanimously hold that intelligence is, to some extent, fixed.
The lines of evidence being heritability studies, stability over time, and neurobiological correlates, among others.
For the curious, the competitive, and the compassionate, this a crushing fact indeed!


<br><br>
<h3 id="1">What is the Cognitive Quantum Jump?</h3>
<b>A Solution?</b> We believe intelligence levels exist!
This plain observation is disputed when intelligence is reduced and made monolithic. 
And it's rightfully resisted when a slice of intelligence is identified with a person's character and worth.
So, to be clear, we hope to neither reduce or misprize intelligence itself.
<br><br>
That being said, perhaps you've pushed yourself and felt the very real limits of your intellect?
Perhaps you've had conversations before and knew the person talking to you was on a higher level of intellect altogether?
This isn't referring to once-in-a-century geniuses, but people that seem to directly be 'on the next level'.
<br><br>
The <i>Cognitive Quantum Jump</i> is the hypothetical possibility of breaking out of your intelligence level to the one above.
Even if that's temporary (mirroring "the zone" or "the flow state"), and even if it can only be done once.
If there's a chance it can be done, then it's worth trying!


<br><br>
<h3 id="1">What is the Decivium?</h3>
The Decivium is a tool to help with the hypothetical Cognitive Quantum Jump.
It comprises a set of texts and tasks paired with 10 Disciplines and a 10 step Routine in a specifically designed way:



<br> The <b>disciplines</b> are many, wide, and balanced! Or, as we say here: polymathic, eurymathic, and isomathic.

	<ul>
	  <Li>Polymathic : Inspired by the trivium and quadrivium, we have selected ten disciplines to learn simultaneously; hence, decivium.</Li>
	  <Li>Eurymathic : Their spread is wide ranging and reflects an aggregated average of modern subjects present in almost all secondary and tertiary institutes of education.</a></Li>
	  <Li>Isomathic : They are paced equally, with an accelerated syllabus divided into 10 grades. Only 1 grade is available on this site presently.</a></Li>
	</ul>

The <b>routine</b> must be practical, daily, and symmetric:

	<ul>
	  <Li>Simple : There are 10 steps, including sleep. And it's so simple it's symmetric.</Li>
	  <Li>Practical : Time is included for exercise, family & friends, work, and studying. Eating, washing, and other tasks are left for you to include.</a></Li>
	</ul>

<br>

<h3 id="1">How can the Decivium give a Cognitive Quantum Jump?</h3>
Currently, "the Decivium can provide the Cognitive Quantum Jump" is a hypothesis demanding to be tested!
First, the Decivium shall briefly explained
