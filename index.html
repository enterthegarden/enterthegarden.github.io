  INTRODUCTION


<div class="story">


  <p>
    Greetings! The Garden is a carefully curated selection of skills procurable to all those without significant time, health, and information restrictions. The selection strikes a balance by including skills needed by both ancestral humans and modern humans. Some skills have precise objective standards attached to them, while others are much more open ended. Most strikingly, some of them have low barriers to entry, while others take a lifetime to master. The individual who has successfully engaged with all of them can live assured that they are a competent individual. It is intended for self-education, but may be freely adopted and adapted for schools. Get competent!

  <p id="farming">
    <b>Farming</b>: Start composting by collecting organic waste (food scraps, leaves) to create nutrient-rich compost for soil enrichment. Understand your soil by testing soil pH & nutrients; tailor farming practices to soil characteristics. Choose crops suited to local climate/soil; rotate crops annually to prevent nutrient depletion & manage pests/diseases. Follow correct timing, depth, spacing for sowing seeds; harden off seedlings before transplanting. Use water-saving irrigation methods (drip irrigation, soaker hoses) to minimise water use & encourage deep roots. Apply mulch to suppress weeds; use companion plants to attract beneficial insects for pest control. Check crops for stress, pests, disease; harvest at peak for best quality. Regularly clean, sharpen, store tools properly for readiness. Stay updated on farming techniques via workshops, community networking.
  </p>

  <p id="nutrition">
    <b>Nutrition</b>: Calculate calorie & nutrient needs based on age, gender, activity level, & health goals. Test & adjust diet to manage food reactions, like allergies, safely. Learn to interpret nutritional facts & ingredient lists on packages (ingredients are listed by abundance). Use local & seasonal produce to boost nutrition & support sustainability. Ensure a mix of proteins, fats, carbs, & essential micronutrients in each meal. Apply proper hygiene & cooking methods to prevent illnesses (esp. washing hands, keeping raw & cooked foods separate). Store food properly to prevent spoilage & contamination (refrigerate perishables, rotate goods). Reduce waste using efficient leftover use & mindful purchasing. Control portions using tools like measuring cups & scales. Monitor symptoms like fatigue & dizziness; manage accordingly. Fast under guidance with proper hydration & nutrient intake. Keep updated with nutritional guidelines & science for diet improvement.
  </p>

  <p id="firstaid">
    <b>First Aid</b>: Verify the scene safety for yourself & the victim before intervening. Assess the emergency's nature, severity, & involved individuals. Dial emergency services for severe situations; provide precise location & details. Check responsiveness, breathing, major bleeding, or life-threatening conditions. Begin CPR (if needed) with chest compressions & rescue breaths if unresponsive & not breathing. If there’s bleeding, use a clean cloth for direct pressure; elevate the wound if possible. Apply the Heimlich manoeuvre or abdominal thrusts if they’re unable to cough, speak, or breathe. Place unconscious but breathing persons in the recovery position to keep their airway clear. For burns, cool them under running water for 10+ minutes, cover with a sterile, non-adhesive bandage. Wash cuts with water, apply antiseptic, & cover with a sterile bandage. Immobilise fractures with splints/bandages; avoid unnecessary movement. For allergies, use epinephrine auto-injector if necessary for severe reactions. Stay with the person, keeping them comfortable without food or drink until help arrives. Track vital signs & changes; provide details to emergency responders.
