<b>Make & Maintain a Fire</b>: Select a safe spot & prep site: Choose an area away from flammables & high winds (avoid under branches). Clear to bare soil & use a rock circle if possible. Gather dry materials: tinder (small twigs, leaves, grass), kindling (larger sticks), or fuel wood (largest pieces). Avoid wet/damp wood (hard to burn, makes smoke). Arrange the materials: Bundle tinder in the centre, or kindling around in teepee, lean-to, or cross-hatch w/ gaps for air. Avoid smothering w/ too much wood (overloading, esp. when small, blocks O2 & kills flames). Ignite tinder: Use a match, lighter, or flint & steel. Direct the spark/flame to the tinder. Gradually add kindling & fuel wood: Start w/ kindling, increase size as fire grows. Add fuel wood once a steady blaze. Maintain the fire: Add wood regularly, manage airflow & layout for an efficient burn. Never leave - it can quickly spread out of control. Extinguish completely: Douse w/ water, stir ashes, ensure embers cool. Repeat if needed.
